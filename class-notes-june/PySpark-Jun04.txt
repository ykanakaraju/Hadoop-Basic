  Spark
  -----
    => Spark is in-memory distributed computing framework for big data analytics.

	in-memory: ability to persist intermediate results in RAM and subsequent operations
		   can directly work on these persisted intermediate results. 

    => Spark is written in Scala programming language

    => Spark is a polyglot
	-> Scala, Java, Python, R (and SQL)

    => Spark applications can run on:
	-> local, Spark standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes

    => Spark is unified analytics framework.
   
  
  Spark Unified Framework
  -----------------------

	Spark provides a consistent set of APIs for performing different analytics workloads
        using the same execution engine and some well defined data abstractions and operations.

   	Batch Analytics of unstructured data	-> Spark Core API (low-level api)
	Batch Analytics of structured data 	-> Spark SQL
	Streaming Analytics (real time)		-> Structured Streaming
	Predictive analytics (ML)		-> Spark MLLib  (mllib & ml)
	Graph parallel computations  		-> Spark GraphX

   Spark Architecture
   ------------------

	1. Cluster Manager (CM)
		-> Applications are submitted to CMs
		-> Allocates containers for lauching driver and executors on the cluster. 
		-> Spark supports multiple CMs
			-> local, standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes		

	2. Driver
		-> Master process
		-> Runs the 'SparkContext' object
		-> Manages the user code and sends the tasks to the executors as per the code. 

		Deploy Modes:
		-> Where to run the driver process
		1. Client : default, driver runs on the client. 
		2. Cluster: driver runs on one of the nodes on the cluster.

	3. SparkContext
		-> Is an application context
		-> Starting point of execution
		-> Is the link between the driver and tasks running on the executors

	4. Executors
		-> Receives the tasks from the Driver
		-> All tasks run the same code but on different partitions of the data
		-> The status of tasks are reported to the driver.
