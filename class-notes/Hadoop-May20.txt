  Pre-requisites
  --------------
     -> SQL
     -> Java 
     -> Python 


  Big Data Introduction
  ---------------------   
     
     Type of data so large and complex that your traditional data processing systems
     can not reasonably store and process. 

   Big Data scenarios
   ------------------
       -> The volume to be handled is very high (much higher than 1 TB)
       -> You want to support real-time analytics (velocity)
       -> You data is growing very fast, so that in no time your system becomes inadeqaute. 
       -> Process unstructured, semi-structured data etc.
    
  Big Data Characteristics
  ------------------------
       -> Volume
       -> Velocity
       -> Variety 
       -> Veracity (correctness of the data)
       -> Value (extracting insights from the data)   
    

  Why your traditional systems have big data problem
  --------------------------------------------------
   -> Because your traditional systems ( that exists in pre-internet era ) are not designed
      for internet scale applications.
 
   -> They are designed to run on a single machine. The single machine has only limited 
      amount of resources.


  Scalability Options
  -------------------
    -> Scale up  (Vertical Scaling)   -> Migrate to a machine with higher configuration
    -> Scala out (Horizontal Scaling) -> Use many machines instead of one. 
                                      -> Use computing cluster

   What is a Computing Cluster?
   ----------------------------
   A unified network of nodes (machines) whose cumulative resources can be used to store
   or process data as if you are working with a single machine. 


   What is a Framework ?
   ---------------------
    A framework is a set of libraries that implement all the basic low-level functionalities
    that the framework is intended for. 

    The users of the framework should focus on the business-logic and implement their solutions 
    as per the guidelines provided by the framework. 


    What is the solution to storage & processing problems associated with Big Data
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    -> Hadoop provides a solution for big-data problems.

 
    What is Hadoop ?
    ----------------     
    Hadoop is a Open Source Framework to Store and Process data in a distributed way 
    using a cluster of commdity harware. 

     -> Components of Hadoop:
	   -> Distributed Storage Solution (HDFS)
	   -> Distributed Processing Solution (MapReduce)
           -> Resource Management (YARN)


   Hadoop Distributions
   --------------------
	Apache Hadoop => Open source
	
	On-Prem & Hybrid Cloud => Cloudera & MapR

	Managed Cloud Solutions 
		-> AWS   : AWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR)
		-> Azure : HDInsignts
	        -> GCP   : DataProc 


    HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
    --------------------------------------

      -> Stores data in the form of "blocks" of 128 MB each
      -> Each block is replicated on other nodes so many times as defined by a 'replication-factor'
           (default rep-factor is 3)      
      
     Q1:  If I want to stote 1024 MB (1 GB) file on HDFS, how much physical storage space 
          is required (using default configs) => 3 GB   

     Q2:  If you want to store 1034 MB file, how many unique blocks are created on HDFS?
	  -> 8 blocks of 128MB each & 1 block of 10 MB
         
	

   Hadoop EcoSystem
   ----------------   
     -> Refers to a set of tools/frameworks/software that run on top of hadoop to solve
        various big data related problems.          

     -> Popular Components in Hadoop EcoSystem             

          -> Resource Management Tool:     YARN
          -> Coordination Management Tool: ZooKeeper
          -> Execution Frameworks: MapReduce, Spark, Tez
          -> SQL-Analytics: Impala, Drill, Hive
	  -> Streaming Data Processing: Kafka, Storm, Spark Streaming
	  -> Machine Learning: Mahout, Spark MLLib
          -> Scripting: Pig
          -> NoSQL database: HBase
          -> Data ingestion tools: Flume, Sqoop

  =======================================================================
     HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
  =======================================================================

   -> Storage Solution
   -> Stores data as blocks of 128 MB 
   -> Each block is replicated.

   HDFS Architecture
   -----------------

   Hadoop uses Master-Slave Architecture


   HDFS Daemons 
   ------------
     -> Daemon: Continuosly running background job. 

     1. Name Node (NN)	
	-> runs on the master machine (master daemon)
        -> recieves heart-beats from DNs.
	   -> if three successive heart-beats are missing from any DN, it is considered as 'dead'
        -> NN maintains two "meta-data" files
	    
           1. FSImage
		-> Persistent disk file
                -> Will contain all the meta-data info from the time that the NN service is started
                   upto the last checkpoint.

	   2. EditLog
		-> Maintained in memory (RAM)
		-> All incrmental changes are recorded in this file.        

     2. Data Node (DN)
	-> runs on every slave machine (salve daemon)
  	-> every DB sends heart-beats to NN once in every 3 seconds
 
        -> In every heart-beat, DN sends "block-report" of that node
           -> A 'block-report' consists of such info as storage data, which files, which blocks, 
              rep-factors, permissions, ...        
    
     3. Secondary Name Node (SNN)
          -> responsible for check-pointing process
              -> check-pointing is a process of merging the edit-log file with fsimage file.

     4. Balancer 
	  -> Ensures that the replication-factor of the files is maintained. 

          -> A file can become "under-replicated" if one nodes that contain the blocks of the file
             goes down, or if the rep-factor of the file is increased. Then balencer creates
             additional replicas of the blocks of that file.  

	  -> A file can become "over-replicated" if one node that contain the blocks that was 
             previously down and comes up again, or if the rep-factor of the file is decreased.
             Then balencer removes the replicas of the blocks of that file beyond the rep-factor.   


   HDFS High Availability
   ----------------------
     
      => Availability : Means that system do not have any down-time. Always available to the client.
    
    
      => Hadoop High Availability is introduced in Hadoop 2.0 onwards. 
	   -> We have "Active NN" and "Stand-by Name Node"

      => Hadoop 1.x is not high availble system.
	   -> In Hadoop 1.x, Name Node is a 'Single Point of Failure'    


   HDFS File Operations
   --------------------

       => HDFS is non-editable file system.

       Default Paths:

 ==========
    YARN
 ==========

   -> Resource Manager

   -> Hadoop 1.0,  MapReduce used to handle resource-management
       -> MR was the only execution process.

   -> Hadoop 2.0
	->  Resource Management:  YARN  (Yet another resource negotiator)
        ->  Execution: MapReduce

        -> Allowed hadoop to support other execution frameworks as-well

      
   YARN Processing Components
   --------------------------
       1. Resource Manager (daemon)  -> one per cluster, runs in a master node
       2. Node Manager (daemon)	     -> one per node, runs in all slave nodes
       3. Application Master         -> one per application, can run in any NN
       4. Set of Containers          -> Allocated to AM where tasks are executed

	

  ==========================================================
     MapReduce
  ==========================================================

   -> Distributed Processing Framework.

    
   Two facets of MapReduce
   ------------------------

    1. MapReduce execution flow (framework process)
	-> How an mR program is executed (what the system does)

	1. Map Phase (developer)  
        2. Combiner
	3. Shuffle & Sort Phase (framework)
        4. Partitioner
	5. Reduce Phase (developer)


    2. MapReduce Programming Structure
	-> How to write MR programs (what developers should do)

	-> An MR Application can have several programs (upto 5 different programs)
   		1. Driver Program 
		       -> master process where configuration details are specified.
		2. Mapper
			-> Logic defined by the developer
			-> has map() method that run once for every input record
		3. Reducer
			-> Logic defined by the developer
			-> has reduce() method that run once for every input record
		4. Combiner
			-> Like a mini-reducer logic applied to the output of each mapper
                        -> Will reduce the amount of data shuffled and improves performance
                        -> Operation has to be commutative.  
		5. Partitioner
			-> Allows the developer to control which keys  goes to which partition
                           based on his own custom implementation.
   
   
   MapReduce Framework Classes
   ---------------------------

   1. InputFormat -> It will identify 'records' from the blocks

   2. InputSplit -> Creates input-split
                    An input-split will have integral number of records.
                    Each input-split can span multiple-blocks.

   3. RecordReader -> Will read input-splits and create (K,V) pairs from the records
                     Call map() method in a mapper with each record.



    MapReduce DataTypes
    -------------------
    -> MR data-types are optimized for serialization & deserialization.
    -> All MR class uses MapReduce Custom Data Types
    
      Java                MapReduce
      ----                ---------
      String		  Text
      Integer		  IntWritable
      Long		  LongWritable
      Boolean		  BoolWritable
      Null		  NullWritable


    Wordcount Program
    -----------------
    Find the word frequency count of all the words in a given text file.
   

    Input-Split
    ------------
InputSplit                          RecordReader			     Mapper -> map(k, v, context) 			    Shuffle & Sort			      Reduce														Shuffle & Sort  			Reduce

    MapReduce Life Cycle Methods
    ----------------------------


	Mapper Life Cycle methods
	--------------------------

	1. setup	-> Called once at the beginning of the MR process before the map() method
                           is called.
			-> Write initialization code.			
			  
	2. map		-> Executed once for every record in the input-split
			-> Write the logic that you want to apply on the record.

	3. cleanup	-> Called once after the map() method is completed for all records.
			-> Release your resource and other cleanup.

	4. run 		-> Generally not overridden
                        -> Can use this to change the execution flow.


	Reducer Life Cycle methods
	---------------------------

	1. setup	-> Called once at the beginning of the MR process before the reduce() method
                           is called.
			-> Write initialization code.			
			  
	2. reduce       -> Executed once for every record in the input-split
			-> Write the logic that you want to apply on the record.

	3. cleanup	-> Called once after the reduce() method is completed for all records.
			-> Release your resource and other cleanup.

	4. run 		-> Generally not overridden
                        -> Can use this to change the execution flow.
   
  
  Required external jars to add to MR project 
  -------------------------------------------
 
   1. Create a Java Project
	File -> New -> Java Project

   2. Right-click on the project 
	-> Build Path -> Configure Buid Path -> Libraries -> Add External JARS
	
	Add the following jar files   
   	-> /usr/lib/hadoop/hadoop-common.jar
   	-> /usr/lib/hadoop-0.20-mapreduce/hadoop-core-mr1.jar

   3. Build the Java Project

	Right-click on the project 
	-> Export -> Java -> Jar File -> Give a name and Finish


 ====================
    Hive
 ====================

    Hive is Hadoop's Data Warehousing Framework.
    
    Hive is an SQL wrapper on top of map-reduce. So that user can directly work with SQL without
    having to write MR programs. HIve Server can create the MR programs and run them on the cluster
    releaving the analysts from writing MR programs.

    => Hive is NOT an RDBMS. 
    => Hive is NOT a NoSQL database

    Hive provides use a dialect of SQL called "Hive Query Language" (HQL, HiveQL)


    Hive Components
    ----------------
  
    1. Hive Warehouse - An HDFS directory where hive stores all its data files of all its managed tables.
                        In cloudera:  /user/hive/warehouse

    2. Hive MetaStore - MetaStore is typically an RDBMS where hive stores its metadata
                        (Most popular option in production systems is MySQL)
                        -> Hive comes with an embedded metastore database called "derby"
        -> WareHouse  : DATA
	-> Meta Store : METADATA

    3. Hive Server   - Responsible for executing HQL statements (and creating MR programs if required)



    How to Access Hive ?
    --------------------

    1. Command Line Interface (CLI Shells)
	-> hive shell  
		-> Local hive installations with default user.
		-> Less secure

        -> beeline shell (preferred for security reasons)
		-> Connects to Hive using JDBC connection with a specific user credential
                -> More secure.

    2. HUE (Hadoop User Environment)
         -> Provides a Web UI to interact with various Hadoop tools.

    3. Client Applications  ( JDBC, ODBC, Thrift )


   Hive File Structure 
   -------------------
   
    Hive Warehouse:  /user/hive/warehouse

    ->  Hive created separate directories for each database in the Hive warehouse
        (exception: no separate directory for 'default' database)

    -> For every table in the database, a separate directory is created.
       All the data files of that table are saved in that directory.

       ex: db1.emp   ==> /user/hive/warehouse/db1.db/emp
	   db1.emp2  ==> /user/hive/warehouse/db1.db/emp2



   To display current database
   ---------------------------
 	set hive.cli.print.current.db=true;   -> To show db name


   Defaults
   --------
        -> default serde: DELIMITED
        -> default storage format : TEXTFILE
        -> default line terminator: \n
        -> default field terminator: Ctrl-A  ( \0001 )           

   Describe
   ---------
        -> desc empinfo
	-> desc extended empinfo
	-> desc formatted empinfo    


--------------------------------------------------------------------
		  CREATE TABLE  & CTAS Construct
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Managed table ---
CREATE TABLE empinfo (empid INT, empname STRING, salary DOUBLE, deptid SMALLINT)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'

    Hive follows Scehma on Read
    ---------------------------
    -> Hive do not control what data goes into the table. 
    -> Schema validation does not happen while "loading" data into the table.
    -> Scahema validation happens while reading the data.
       -> If the data can not be parsed as per schema, Hive shows NULL for that field.


    Managed Tables
    --------------
        -> Managed tables are managed by Hive and are stored in Hive warehouse directory.
        -> When you drop a managed table, Hive drops the schema as well as the data files. 

    
    External Tables
    ---------------
        -> External tables are not managed by Hive.
        -> The data files of external table are not stored in Hive warehouse. 
        -> They are stored in an external location specified while creating the table.
        -> The data loaded into external table either from hive or from any other application/tool
           is not owned/managed by Hive.
        -> When we drop the table, ONLY schema is dropped. The data files are NOT DROPPED.
  

    Use Cases for External tables
    -----------------------------

       -> External tables are used when multiple hive databases are using the same data. 
       -> You can create an external table pointing to existing data, analyze that data and drop the
          table without affecting the actual data.




    Partitioned Tables
    ------------------

     In Hive, Partitions provide a way of dividing a table into coarse-grained 
     parts based on the value of a partition column, such as a date or country.


     Partitioning allows us to create tables partitioned by one or more columns.
     
     Each unique value of the partitioned column will have its own directory 
     within the table's directory.

     Based on the way we load data into the tables we can have static & dynamic partitions

     -> Partition columns should reasonably low-cardinality columns (such as year, country, month, ...)


     Static Partitioning
     -------------------
	-> The data files are loaded by the user using "LOAD DATA .." command
        -> The user has to know precisly to which partition he is loading the file.


     Dynamic Partitioning
     --------------------
	-> We dynamic partitioning when the user do not know to which partition the data goes to.
           This may be because the partition info itself is there in the data or may be we have
           data of many partitions in the same file. 

        -> We can not use "LOAD DATA.." command to load the data into the partitioned table

        -> We have to load the data using dynamic partitioning scheme from a base table using
           "INSERT .. SELECT .." command. 

        -> Data files are created dynamically by hive (hense the name dynamic partitioning)

        -> set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict

                       -> As aggregations are heavily used in analytical warkloads, these formats are very
                          efficient in data-warehouseing like use-cases.

                   => Very good read performance

  Joins
  -----

   Hive supports the following joins:

	-> inner join
	-> outer joins (left outer, right outer, full outer)
        -> left semi join


   Left Semi Join:
   ---------------
	-> The data fetched only from left side table for the keys that are there in the joined table.
        -> Very much like inner join, except that the data comes only from left side table.

         -> Left Semi Join is an alias of the following query.
	
		=> select * from emp where deptid in (select deptid from dept)
                => select * from emp left semi join dept on (emp.deptid = dept.deptid);

            (both the above queries are functionally same)


   Map-side Joins
   --------------
       -> map-joins are very efficient and aviods the reduce phase completed.
       -> The join is performed at the map-phase itself. 

        Conditions for performing map-join automatically:

	    -> set hive.auto.convert.join = true   (defaul is true)
            -> All the tables except one must be 'small table'. 
		 -> Small table is defined by the following parameter:
                      hive.mapjoin.smalltable.filesize (default: 25MB)

       If both the tables that are joined are big tables (> hive.mapjoin.smalltable.filesize), then
       hive does not perform map-join.
 
          -> In this case, developers have to apply optimizations to improve join efficiency.

        1. Bucket Map Join	
              -> Both the tables that are joined must be bucketted on the join column
              -> The number of buckets of one table should be a multiple of other.
              -> Set the following config setting: 
			set hive.enforce.bucketing = true; 
			set hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin = true;

        2. Sort Merge Join 
	      -> Both the tables that are joined must be bucketted on the join column
              -> The number of buckets of both tables must be same
              -> Set the following config setting: 
			set hive.input.format=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.BucketizedHiveInputFormat;
			set hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin = true;
			set hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin.sortedmerge = true;

===========================
   Impala
===========================

   -> General purpose SQL engine developed by Cloudera. 
	-> Works for both analytical and transactional loads (interactive queries)
        -> Supports queries that take milliseconds upto hours.

   -> Real time query processing engine for Hadoop
        -> Uses its own processing engine called "Massive Parallel Parocessing (MPP)" database engine.

   -> Runs directly on top of HDFS
	-> Does not use MR
	-> Reads widely used hadoop formats (ORC, Parquet, SequenceFile, Text, AVRO)
	-> Can co-exist with Hadoop cluster 

    -> High Peformance
	-> Written in C++ mostly (some Java)
        -> Used run-time code generation
	-> completly new execution engine.

    -> Impala uses:
	 -> The same metastore as Hive.
	 -> Uses the same SQL (Hive Query Language)
	 -> Uses the hive warehouse to store its tables.
       

   Meta Data and Table Data in Impala
   -----------------------------------
    => Whenever hive metadata changes outside of impala (may be by hive) that metadata is not automatically
       refreshed in Impala Catalog.
          -> Impala maintains a catalog where it caches all the metadata.
       => To refresh impala catalog use the following command:
	   -> "INVALIDATE METADATA"

    => Whenever new data is added to a table outside of impala, we have to run the following command
       to refresh the table in impala:
	   -> REFRESH <table-name>


   Impala Daemons & Impala Architecture
   ------------------------------------

    1. impalad
	-> runs on every node on the impala cluster
	-> accepts client requests / queries
        -> performs planning, coordination and execution of the client queries
        -> distributes the query execution across many nodes and coordinates them
        -> sends the results back to client.

         Three Processes:
		-> Query Planner
		-> Query Coordinator
		-> Query Executors (distributed across many nodes)

    2. statestored
        -> Runs on only one node in cluster
	-> All the impalad nodes communicate with statestored continuosly
        -> if any node is down, then that info is communicated to all the impala nodes

    3. catalogd
	-> Maintains the metadata
	-> Any changes to the metadata are relayed to all impalad nodes
	-> If metadata changes happen outside of the impala cluster (for ex by hive), those
           changes have to refreshed using "invalidate metadata" command.

   Sqoop
 ======================
  -> Sqoop   => SQL on Hadoop  -> (SQl hadOOP)

  -> Structured Data Ingestion Tool
  -> Built on top of MapReduce.

  -> Using Sqoop, you can import data from external SQL datastores (RDBMS) to Hadoop native data stores (HDFS, Hive, HBase). 

  -> Sqoop launches multiple map-only tasks on the cluster to efficiently and parallely transfer bulk data between RDBMS and Hadoop systems.

   RDBMS Database Limitations:
   ---------------------------

      -> Scalability limitations
	  -> They run on a single machine
	  -> Can not support unlimited scalability.
          -> Not designed as distributed databases.

      -> Does not support dynamic schemas
	  -> RDBMSs have fixed schema
          -> All rows of a table have same number of columns.
	  -> Does not support schema evolution. 
   

   NoSQL Databases
   ---------------
      -> Designed as distributed databases.
	  -> All NoSQL databases run on a cluster.
      -> Uses denormalized data models
	  -> Non-relational
	  -> All the data of a single entity is stored in the same table
          -> No joins
      -> Schema-less (flexible schema)
	  -> Each row need not have same number of columns
          -> Columns need not be part of the table structure.  
          -> Supports applications with schema evolution


   Types of NoSQL databases
   ------------------------
	
        1. Column (column-family) orieted databases (Ex: HBase, Cassandra)
	2. Document oriented databases (ex: MongoDB, CouchDB, DynamoDB)
	3. Key-value Stores (ex: Redis)
	4. Graph Databases (ex: Neo4J)
  
     
   Limitations of Hadoop
   ---------------------         
      -> Unstructured Data
            -> HDFS does not have any schema
	    -> They are just files
	
      -> No Random Access supported
	    -> Even to read a single record, you have process the entire file.
         
      -> High Latency
	    -> MR does not have throughput to support transactional databases.

       -> Not ACID complaint
	    -> Databases are reliable source of data because of ACID guarantees. 

    HBase   
    -----
        -> Is a distributed database management system that provides transactional processing
	    -> Part of Hadoop ecosystem.
	
        -> Three seminal papers of Google (published bw 2003 & 2006)
	     -> Google File System	: HDFS
	     -> MapReduce		: MapReduce
	     -> Google Big Table	: HBase


	-> HDFS uses HDFC to store persistent data
		-> distributed storage
		-> fault tolerant.


   Features of HBase
   -----------------
	-> Is a column-family oriented database
	-> HBase does support SQL
	-> Denormalized data design
	    -> We don't normalize table
	    -> Store all data in a single table 
		-> organize data as column-families
	-> Uses column-oriented storage
	    -> more like a map than a table (in RDBMS sense)
	-> HBase only supports a basic set of operations (CRUD) on a "single-row"
	    -> All operations are applied at "row-level"
	    -> No Joins
	    -> No Group By (aggregartions)
	    -> No Sub-Queries
	-> Very limited ACID complience
	    -> ACID complience is at row-level.


   Working with HBase
   ------------------

    1. Client Application (using Java API)
    2. HBase Shell
    3. Web Clients (using thrift service) - HUE


    HBase Data Model
    ----------------

	-> The basic unit of data is a "column" (or cell)

	-> A row is identified by an "row-id"
	-> Every column belongs a column-family and has a row-id attached to it
		-> all the columns with the same row-id make up a row
	-> Each row can have its own set of columns.
	-> Each column will have 
		-> A row-id
		-> A column-family
		-> A value
		-> A timestamp (generated by Hbase)

		-> A cell is a key-value pair
			Key: (Row-Id, Col-Identifie)   col-id => column-family:column-name
			Value: Value, TimeStamp

			Key: (1, 'basic:name')
			     ("raju", 16020456345237)

	-> Each cell is versioned.
		-> A cell added with the same row-id and same column-identifier with 
		   a different will result in a new version of the cell being created with
		   a different (latest) timestamp.
		-> version is identified by a timestamp

	-> The number of versions you want to maintain can be configured for each column-family
		-> default is 1.

   	-> Basic unit of data is a cell
	    -> We can insert one cell
	    -> We can update one cell
	    -> We can delete one cell
                  -> UNlike RDBMS, where we work with rows.

  NOTE:  Apache Hbase is usually used along with Apache Phoenix, which provides an SQL-like 
         interface for developers.

  Hive - HBase Integration
  ------------------------

   -> We can create a  table in Hive using Hbase as the storoge Handler (HbaseStorageHandler)
   -> We can map the columns of the hive table with a hbase table
   -> We can perform update, delete and random data access etc on hive table using hbase.

$ hive --auxpath /usr/lib/hive/lib/hive-hbase-handler-0.10.0-cdh4.7.0.jar,/usr/lib/hive/lib/hbase.jar,/usr/lib/hive/lib/zookeeper.jar,/usr/lib/hive/lib/guava-11.0.2.jar


   CREATE TABLE hiveempinfo (key int, empname string, salary double) 
STORED BY 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HBaseStorageHandler' 
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ("hbase.columns.mapping" = ":key,emp:empname,emp:salary") 
TBLPROPERTIES ("hbase.table.name" = "hbaseempinfo");


=> In the above command:
   -> The first column (key) is mapped to hbase row-key identified by :key
   -> The second column (empname) is mapped to hbase column emp:empname, 
      where 'emp' is the CF and empname is the column.
   -> The third column (salary) is mapped to hbase column emp:salary, where 'emp' is the CF and salary is the column.
   -> The hbaseempinfo table is automatically created. 

# load data into hive (deserialized) table just created
hive> INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE hiveempinfo SELECT empid, empname, salary FROM empinfo;

NOTE: when you load data into the hive table the corresponding HBase table is also populated 
with the same data. Now, you can do DML operations in HBase and see the changes reflected in Hive.

-------------------

  
  HBase Architecture
  ------------------

   Google published three seminal papers between 2003 and 2006

    1. Google File System	: HDFS
    2. MapReduce			: MapReduce
    3. Google Big Table		: HBase   


  => HBase is a "sorted nested map": <Row-ID, <Column-Family, <Column, <TimeStamp Value>>>
  
  => When you read data from hbase, it performs a random-access lookup on the row-id
  => When you write data to hbase, hbase inserts the row in the 'right-place'
	-> These are possible with "regions"
  
  Region => Is a contiguous range of row-ids.
	    Each region is stored in a region-server.
            Serve as an index to perform fast lookup for where a row belongs to. 
	    Regions are distributed across the cluster among many region-servers
           
  Region-Server => run on all the slave nodes of hbase cluster
		   host zero or more regions
 

  With in each region-server:

      1. WAL (write-ahead-log)  - hdfs file which records all incoming data changes (writes/updates)
      2. MemStore  - one per column-family
		     in-memory buffer where all data changed are recorded
		     write-buffer
      3. HFile - periodically, memstore contents are flushed to HFiles (stored in HDFS)
      4. Block Cache - maintains an index of row-keys to HFile blocks
		       used for fast-random access.



 =====================
     Kafka
 =====================

  -> Distributed Publisher-Subscriber Messaging Engine and Streaming Data Platform.
  -> Kafka runs on a cluster and hense provide very high scalability
  -> Kafka is mainly writen in Scala (programming language)
   
   Kafka can be seen from 3 perspectives:
	-> distributed commit-log  (intermediate storage layer)
        -> pub/sub messaging system (producers can produce and consumers can consume) 
        -> distributed streaming platform (you can write streaming applications)


  Installing Kafka
  -----------------
  
	-> Download kafka binaries from the following location.
		https://kafka.apache.org/downloads

        -> Extract the tar ball to a suitbale location.

	-> Both windows and linux binaries are available in the same package.
	
    
  Kafka Building Blocks
  ---------------------

   1. Broker
	-> Each kafka service running on a node in the kafka cluster is a broker. 
	-> Every broker in a cluster has a unique broket-id
	-> Brokers communicate with a central Zookeeper cluster to maintain their state
	-> Broker store data as 'topics' (stored on disk) as commit-logs.
	
	-> Runs by default on port 9092 (configurable)

  2. Zookeeper
	-> Acts as central coordination service
        -> All brokers communicate (heartbeats) with zookeeper.
	-> A cluster is formed by having multiple brokers communicating with the same zookeeper.

  3. Topic
	-> Is a distributed sequential commit-log that stores messages of same type (like a table)
	-> Every brokers stores its topic on the disk at a disignated location
		-> log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs
	-> Each topic is organized as multiple partitions
        -> A message is uniquely identified by (topic, partition, offset-id)

   4. Topic Partitions
	-> Each topic is organized as multiple partitions
 		-> Partitions are distribited across multiple brokers
		-> Each broker can store 0 or more partitions
	-> Every partition has replicas (to provide fail-safety)
	-> Only one replica of each partition is designated as "leader" partition
	-> All reads/writes go only to the leader partitions
	-> If the broker containing the leader partition goes down, Zookeeper triggers an
	   election, and one of the (in-sync) replicas is elected as "leader" replica.

  5. Producer
	-> Is a client that writes data to a topic
	-> The messages produced by producer are distributed among all the partitions of the topic
	    -> The distribution logic can be controlled using custom partition.
	    -> Kafka applies its default partitioning logic in the absense of a custom partitioner.

  6. Consumer
	-> Is a client application that subscribes to a topic and polls data from the topic
	-> The consumer consumes the messages and write the offsets that are consumed to a 
	   __consumers_offsets topic
		-> This is consumer tracks what messages have been consumed.

  => Bootstrap Server: 
	Is one of the active brokers in the cluster through which a client can establish a conncetion to the entire cluster.
	NOTE: You are not connecting to any specific broker. You are connecting to cluster as a whole.
 


  Working with Kafka
  ------------------

   # Start Zookeeper
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   $bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties


   # Start a Kafka Broker
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   $bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties 


   # Kafka Topic Operations
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   $bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
   $bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic topic1 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
   $bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic topic1

  # Kafka Console Producer
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  $bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic topic1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

  

  $bin/kafka-console-producer.sh \
  	--bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  	--topic my-topic \
  	--property "parse.key=true" \
  	--property "key.separator=:"

 
  # Kafka Console Consumer
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  $bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic topic1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

  # to read from the beginning of the topic 
  $bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic topic1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning

  #create a consumer group using console comsumer
  $bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic topic1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --consumer.config config/consumer.properties



  Kafka APIs
  ----------

   1. Producer API 
	-> Used to write producer applications

   2. Consumer API
	-> Used to write consumer application

   3. Streams API
	-> Used to write streaming application that can enrich/modify events in existing topics 
           in real-time and write modified events to other topics.
        -> Kafka-to-Kafka workloads

   4. Connect API   
	-> Move data in real time between two desperate data systems in real time   



   Message distribution protocol
   -----------------------------     
    A message can have :

	-> topic   (mandatory, not data)
	-> value   (mandatory, the content of the message)
	-> key	   (optional, but mostly we have a key)
	-> partition-id  (optional)
	-> timestamp (optional, event-time)

    1. If the message contains a partition-id, then the message will be delivered to that partition.
    2. If we define a custom-partitioning logic (based on the key) then the message will be sent to 
       the partition as per the output of the custom partitioner (for that key)
    3. If you do not define a custom partitioner, then the partition will be decided based on the key
       of the message using the default hash partitioning logic.
    4. If the message has no key at all, the messages are distributed randomly in a load-balanced manner.



    Single-node Multiple Broker Kafka Setup
    ---------------------------------------   
       
			broker.id	port		log.dir
    	Broker: 0	0		9092		/tmp/kafka-logs
	Broker: 1	1		9093		/tmp/kafka-logs-1			
	Broker: 2	2		9094		/tmp/kafka-logs-2
   
	=> define the protocol, ip and port:   		listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092
   	=> defines where kafka broker saves its logs:   log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs


    Consumer Groups
    ---------------

	$bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
 	$bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group my-group
    	 --reset offsets for a consumer group

 	$bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --group my-group --reset-offsets --to-earliest --execute --topic topic1
     		 NOTE: The possible values for --reset-offsets are:
	 	--to-datetime, --by-period, --to-earliest, --to-latest, --shift-by, --from-file & --to-current

 	$bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --group my-group --reset-offsets --shift-by 2 --execute --topic topic1
