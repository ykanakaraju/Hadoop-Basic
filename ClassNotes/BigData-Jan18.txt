   Big Data
   --------    
   Type of data which large and complex that your traditional data processing systems
   can not reasonably store and process.


   Big Data scenarios
   ------------------
       -> The volume to be handled is very high (much higher than 1 TB)
       -> You want to support real-time analytics (velocity)
       -> You data is growing very fast, so that in no time your system becomes inadeqaute. 
       -> Process unstructured, semi-structured data etc.

    
  Big Data Characteristics
  ------------------------
       -> Volume
       -> Velocity
       -> Variety 
       -> Veracity (correctness of the data)
       -> Value (extracting insights from the data)   
    

  Why your traditional systems have big data problem
  --------------------------------------------------
   -> Because your traditional systems (that exists in pre-internet era) are not designed
      for internet scale applications.
 
   -> They are designed to run on a single machine. The single machine has only limited 
      amount of resources.

  
  Scalability Options
  -------------------
    -> Scale up  (Vertical Scaling)   -> Migrate to a machine with higher configuration
    -> Scala out (Horizontal Scaling) -> Use many machines instead of one. 
                                      -> Use computing cluster

   What is a Computing Cluster?
   ----------------------------
   A unified network of nodes (machines) whose cumulative resources can be used to store
   or process data as if you working with a single machine. 


   What is a Framework ?
   ---------------------
    A framework is a set of libraries that implement all the basic low-level functionalities
    that the framework is intended for. The users of the framework should focus on the 
    business-logic and implement their solutions as per the guidelines provided by the 
    framework. 



   What is the solution to storage & processing problems associated with Big Data
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    -> Hadoop provides a solution for big-data problems.

 
   What is Hadoop ?
   ----------------     
    Hadoop is a Open Source Framework to Store and Process data in a distributed way 
    using a cluster of commdity harware. 

     -> Provides two things:
	   -> Distributed Storage Solution (HDFS)
	   -> Distributed Processing Solution (MapReduce)
           -> Resource Management (YARN)


    Hadoop Distribution Modes
    -------------------------

	1. standalone mode   
		-> All daemons run in the same JVM in the same machine

	2. psudo distribution mode
		-> All daemons run in the separate JVMs in the same machine

	3. (full) distribution mode
		-> Different daemons run on different nodes (production deployment)



    HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
    --------------------------------------

      -> Stores data in the form of "blocks" of 128 MB each
      -> Each block is replicated on other nodes so many times as defined by a 'replication-factor'
           (default rep-factor is 3)      
      
     Q1:  If I want to stote 1024 MB (1 GB) file on HDFS, how much physical storage space 
          is required (using default configs) => 3 GB   

     Q2:  If you want to store 1034 MB file, how many unique blocks are created on HDFS?
	  -> 8 blocks of 128MB each & 1 block of 10 MB



 =============================================================================
   HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File Systems
 =============================================================================

    -> Stores data in the form of blocks
    -> Each block is replicated (by default, 3 times)

    HDFS Daemons   
    -------------

	-> Daemon: continuously running background job
        -> Name Node (NN)
		-> Runs on the master machine
		-> Maintains two file called "FSImage" & "EditLog" file

                -> FSImage:  Stores all storage related info from the starting of the cluster up to
                             last check-point. 
                              
                             Persistent file stored on disk.

		-> Edit Log: Stores the ongoing actions related to storage from the last check-point
                             and is stored in RAM


        -> Data Node (DN)
		-> Runs in each slave machine
		-> Sends heart-beats to NN once in 3 sec, If NN does not receive 3 heart-beats, it 
                   will mark the slave node as dead. 
		-> DNs send "block-reports" to NN in heart-beats. 


        -> Secondary Name Node (SNN)
		-> Runs on a serapare machine. 
 		-> Responsible for check-pointing process
                   -> Check-pointing is the process of merging editLog with fSImage and copy the new
                      fsImage file back to the NN. 

        -> Balancer
		-> A background process that monitors the replication of files and maintains the 
                   proper replication factor.
                -> Files can become under-replicated (when a DN goes down) or over-replicated when
                   a previously down DN comes backup. Or when we change the exiting replication-factor
                   of the file.
                -> Balancer maintains proper replication in such cases, by creating additional replicas or
                   by deleting overly replicated blocks.


   HDFS High Avaialability
   -----------------------

    => In Hadoop 1.x, NN was a 'single-point-of-failure'

    => Hadoop 2.0 onwards, Hadoop HA concept is introduced where Hadoop maintains Active/StandBy Name Node.

       => Active Name Node and StandBy Nama Node shared the meta-data in real-time using a 
          shared storage system called "Quorum Journal Manager". 
       => If Active NN goes down automatically the standBy NN will become Active NN.  
       => The StandBy subsumes the role of "secondary name node"


   Hadoop Distributions
   --------------------

     -> Hadoop Distributions package and pre-configure a set of commonly used hadoop eco-system components.
     
     -> Using these distribution will save us a lot time and effort, because we don't have to download and 
        install them separatly.

     -> Because all distributions use "open-source" software, they provide one free version and many offer
        licensed version where they provide separate admin-tools and so on.


     Popular distributions:
     ----------------------

       On-premisis Clusters
       --------------------
	-> Cloudera  (CDH 4.7, CDH 5.13, 5.14...)
	-> HortonWorks  (merged with Cloudera in 2019)
        -> MapR

       Cloud Clusters
       --------------
       -> AWS:  EMR (Elastic Map Reduce)
       -> Azure: HadoopInsights  


   Q: Haw many maximum name nodes we can have?
   -------------------------------------------

     Only one "Active" name node (generally) --> one or more Stand-by Name Node

     Very large clusters  may use multiple Active NNs using a concept called "Hadoop Syndication" where 
     each Active NN maintains one or few name-space.

 =============================================
     MapReduce
 =============================================

     -> Is a distributed computing framework

     Two perspectives:

	-> MapReduce Framework  (How MapReduce execute user-applications)
		-> Mapper Phase (developer will write logic)
		-> Shuffle & Sort Phase (framework will do this)
		-> Reduce Phase (developer will write logic)

	-> MapReduce Programming Paradigm
		-> How to write Map-Reduce programs:
		
		-> MapReduce Program contains several files (maximum 5 files)

			-> Driver Program (mandatory)
			    -> Define the configurations of the program

			-> Mapper Program (mandatory, kind of)
    			    -> Define business logic to be executed by the mappers

			-> Reducer Program (mostly used, but not mandatory)
			    -> Define business logic related to aggregation of results of mappers

			-> Combiner Program (optional)
			    -> Is a reducer applied to the output of every mapper, so that the number
                               of (K, V) pairs produced by the mapper can be reduced.

                            -> This reduces the amount of the data that has to be shuffled in the 
                               S&S phase.

                            -> This is an optimization.

                            -> This is useful in only those cases where your operation is commutative
                               (the order does not matter, like addition)
        
                        -> Partitioner Program (optional)      			
			    -> Allows developer to specify partitioning logic to control which keys
                               go to which partition

                            -> Only useful when you are having many reducers.


       Mapper => Combiner (like mini-reducer) => Shuffle & Sort => Partitioner => Reducer


    Reference Libraries to be added to your MR programs
    ---------------------------------------------------

	/usr/lib/hadoop/hadoop-common.jar
	/usr/lib/hadoop-0.20-mapreduce/hadoop-core-2.6.0-mr1-XXX.jar


    Executing a Map-Reduce Program
    ------------------------------

    $hadoop jar <jar-file-path> <driver-class-qualified-name> <command-line-args>
    $hadoop jar /home/cloudera/mrpractice.jar com.sample.WordCountJob <input-path> <output-dir>

    // To submit to YARN
    $yarn jar /home/cloudera/mrpractice.jar com.sample.WordCountJob <input-path> <output-dir>


   MapReduce Framework Classes
   ---------------------------

   1. InputFormat  -> Is to identify "records" from the block.
                   -> For text files each line is regarded as a record. 

   2. InputSplit   -> create a whole number of records that can span
                       one or many blocks. 
		   -> Each map task processes one input-split.

   3. RecordReader -> Will reader each record from the input-split and calls
                      the "map" method that is defined inside the Mapper class.
  


    Hadoop Data Types
    -----------------

     => All hadoop classes work with only hadoop data types
     => Hadoop data types are optimized for serialization and deserialization
          -> They implement Writer and Comparator interfaces. 
     
       Java         	Hadoop
       ----         	------        
	String		Text
	Integer		IntWritable
	Long		LongWritable
	Null		NullWritable
	Bool		BoolWritable
  

   Mapreduce Life Cycle Methods
   ----------------------------


    Mapper Class: 
    -------------
	 
	1. setup    -> called once at the beginning (before the map method called for the first record)
		    -> define initializations, define global vars. 

	2. map	    -> once per record
                    -> define the logic to be applied on each record

	3. cleanup  -> executed once after all the records are processed
		    -> to cleanup resources or write collect data into the context

	4. run	    -> generally not overridden
		    -> controls the execution flow.

    Reducer Class:
    --------------
	
	1. setup    -> called once at the beginning (before the reduce method called for the first record)
		    -> define initializations, define global vars. 

	2. reduce   -> once per record
                    -> define the logic to be applied on each record

	3. cleanup  -> executed once after all the records are processed
		    -> to cleanup resources or write collect data into the context

	4. run	    -> generally not overridden
		    -> controls the execution flow.



 ==============================
	Hive
 ==============================
	
   Hive -> Data Warehousing Framework for Hadoop built on top of MapReduce
        -> Provides an SQL wrapper on top of MR, so that developers can work with SQL (and not MR)
        -> Hive provides a dialect of SQL called "Hive Query Language" (HQL / HiveQL)

        -> Hive is not an RDBMS/NoSQL database
	   -> Hive does not have constraints such as PKs, FKs, etc..
	   -> All the data is stored as data-files in "hive warehouse" directory. 

        -> Hive, by default, uses MR as the execution framework. 

        -> From Hive 2.x onwards, Hive can be configured to use other distributed execution 
           frameworks also, instead of MR. 

		-> Tez is widely used. 
                -> Hive can be configured to use 'Spark' also.  


   Important components of Hive:
   ----------------------------

      1. Hive Warehouse  => Is a directory managed by hive in HDFS
                            Where Hive stores all data files of all databases & tables that it manages.
			    default location: /user/hive/warehouse 


      2. Hive Metastore  => Usually it is an RDBMS (usually MySQL) in production system.
                            Also comes with embedded metastote called "Derby"
                            Hive stores all its metadata in Hive metastore.

         ** Actual data files are stored in Hive Warehouse
         ** All the metadata is managed in Hive MetaStore 

      3. Hive Query Engine (Hive Server) => Responsible for executing Hive QL statements.


   How To Connect to Hive
   ----------------------

    1. CLI (Command Line Interface) 

       -> Two Shells:
		-> Hive Shell :    Suitable for local hive installation
				   Less Secure

                -> Beeline Shell : Connects to local/remote Hive through JDBC connection.
                                   Better Security

    2. HUE (Hadoop User Environment)

    3. Client Applications 
		-> Can connect to Hive using JDBC, ODBC, Thrift. 
                -> For external applications and tools to connect to Hive

  
    Hive Database File Structure
    ----------------------------

    -> All managed table are stored in a warehouse directory @ "/user/hive/warehouse"
	
    -> Under the warehouse directory each user-created database will have its own (<db-name>.db) directory
	ex: 'db1' database is localed at:    /user/hive/warehouse/db1.db  
	
    -> Under the database directory, each table will have its own directory
	ex: "db1.emp" table's datafiles are localed at:    /user/hive/warehouse/db1.db/emp/<data-files>

    Exception: "default" database has no separate directory inside hive warehouse dir. 
               All the tables that belong to "default" database are stored directly under  "/user/hive/warehouse" directory.
    

  
   Working with Hive Tables
   ------------------------
    
    -> Data is loaded into Hive tables generaly in two ways:
	  1. From external files such as demilited files (like CSV, TSV), parquet files, ORC files, Seqence files etc..
          2. From already existing table using "INSERT..SELECT"
          3. Inserting data into table using "INSERT INTO .. VALUES(..)" command is supported,
             but not preferred.

     Defaults:
     ---------
	* STORAGE FORMAT:  TEXTFILE
        * Lines Terminator: \n
        * Fields Terminator: Ctrl-A (\0001)

     Describe Tables
     ---------------
       	$describe empinfo
	$describe extended empinfo
	$describe formatted empinfo;
   

    => Can hive validate data while loading agaist the schema of the table ?  NO

  
    Schema on Read
    --------------
    -> Hive does not validate data while loading (using LOAD DATA command)
    -> Hive validates the data on reading. 
	-> If some field can not parse as per the defined datatype, Hive simply returns NULL

    Managed Tables
    --------------

     -> Managed Table are owned by Hive and is stored inside hive warehouse.
     -> When you drop the table Hive drops both the schema from metastore and the 
        data-files from the warehouse. 


    External Tables
    ---------------

     -> External tables are tables whose data resides outside of hive warehouse.
     -> External tables are not managed by Hive.
     -. When you drop an external table, only the schema is dropped (from metastore) but not the datafiles. 
     -> Using external tables, we can connect to existing data and analyse that data using Hive without
        owning that data.


    Partitioned Tables
    ------------------

      -> Hive allows us to partition table into many dircetories based on one or more columns. 

      -> By partitioning your table, you can reduce the amount of data files that Hive have to scan 
         if query has the partition column specified. 

      -> When you partition a table by a column, Hive creates a separate directory within the
         table's directory, for every unique value of the partition column.

      -> Based on how we load the data into partitioned tables, we can think of partitioning as two types

       1. Static Parititioning	

          -> Is applied when our data does not have the partition info and we hardcode the partition
             value in the "LOAD" statement.

       2. Dynamic Partitioning

	  -> When we can not decide into which partition the data file will go to (because the file 
             may have the partition data itself and may have data for several partition.), then we
             use dynamic partitioning approach.

	  -> Here, we do not use "LOAD" statements to load, instead we load data from a base table 
             using "INSERT..SELECT" command. 

          -> You have set the following config to load using dynamic partitioning
                set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict
  

    Limitations of Partitioning
    ---------------------------

     -> What if your partitions are too big, and you want further reduce the amount of data
        in a given partition into more segments.		
	   => In this case, we may using bucketting within each partition. And we create some
              predefined number of segments within each partition.

     -> What if your partitions are too small (like for eaxmple partitioning by high cardinality
        columns such as product_id, name, email ....). MR is not efficient with lot of small file.
        In such cases, partitioning may be a solution at all.
	    => You can use bucketting at the table level and define a predefined number of buckets. 


   Bucketing
   ----------

    -> Allows you to organize your data into some predefined number of segments. This will add another
       layer of segmentation on top of partitioning. Or you can also bucket at the table level.

       Table data file structure in Hive
       ----------------------------------

       	DATABASE --> TABLE
       	DATABASE --> TABLE --> PARTITIONS
		DATABASE --> TABLE --> BUCKETS
		DATABASE --> TABLE --> PARTITIONS --> BUCKETS
       
    
      Loading data into bucketted tables
      ----------------------------------

	-> Can not use "LOAD DATA .." statements
	-> Should use "INSERT .. SELECT" command to load data into bucketted table.
	-> set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;  // enforce bucketting

      
     Managing Output
     ---------------

     [select * from emp]    
	--> return the results to the client;
	--> insert/overwrite the data into a table  (INSERT .. SELECT)
        --> create a table with the query output (CREATE TABLE AS SELECT)
        --> Save the contents of the query into a local/hdfs directory in the desired format.

 ==================================
      Spark  (using PySpark)
 ==================================
   
    -> Spark is in-memory distributed computing framework

    -> Spark is used for big data analysis

    -> Spark is written in Scala
	-> We can write Spark applications in Scala, Java, Python & R

    -> Spark is 'unified' analytics framework

	Spark provides a consistent set of APIs for performing different analytics workloads
        using the same execution engine and some well defined data abstractions and operations.

   	Batch Analytics of unstructured data	-> Spark Core API (low-level api)
	Batch Analytics of structured data 	-> Spark SQL
	Streaming Analytics (real time)		-> Spark Streaming, Structured Streaming
	Predictive analytics (ML)		-> Spark MLLib
	Graph parallel computations  		-> Spark GraphX

   -> Spark applications can run on clusters managed by multiple cluster managers
  

  Spark Architecture
  ------------------

    	1. Cluster Manager (CM)
		-> Applications are submitted to CMs
		-> Allocates containers for lauching driver and executors on the cluster. 
		-> Spark supports multiple CMs
			-> local, standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes		

	2. Driver
		-> Master process
		-> Runs the 'SparkContext' object (represents an application)
		-> Manages the user code and sends the tasks to the executors as per the code. 

		Deploy Modes:
		-> Where to run the driver process
		 1. Client : default, driver runs on the client. 
		 2. Cluster: driver runs on one of the nodes on the cluster.

	3. SparkContext
		-> Is an application context
		-> Starting point of execution
		-> Is the link between the driver and tasks running on the executors

	4. Executors
		-> receives the tasks from the Driver
		-> all tasks run the same execution code but on different partitions of the data
		-> the status of tasks are reported to the driver.

  RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)
  -----------------------------------
    -> RDD is the fundamental data abstraction in Spark Core API
	
    -> RDD is a collection of distributed in-memory partitions.
	-> Each partition is a collection of objects of some type.

    -> RDDs are immutable

    -> RDDs are lazily evaluated
	-> Transformations does not cause execution
	-> Action commands cause execution. 
  
    
  Creating RDDs
  -------------
	
    Three ways:

	1. Create an RDD from external data files.

		rddFile = sc.textFile( <filePath>, 4 )

		default Number of partitions: sc.defaultMinPartition
		  sc.defaultMinPartition = 2, if number of cores >= 2
					   1, otherwise

	2. Create an RDD from programmatic data

		rdd1 = sc.parallelize([2,4,3,1,5,6,7,8,6,8,9,0,7,5,4,6,8], 2)
		
		default Number of partitions: sc.defaultParallelism
		sc.defaultParallelism = number of CPU cores allocated.


	3. By applying transformations on existing RDDs

		rdd2 = rdd1.map(lambda x: x*10)


  RDD Operations
  --------------
	Two types of operations

	1. Transformations
		-> Transformations return RDDs
		-> Transformations does not cause execution of RDDs
		-> Cause lineage DAGs to be created

	2. Actions
		-> Triggers execution of RDDs
		-> Produces output


  RDD Lineage DAG
  ---------------
  Driver maintains a Lineage DAG for every RDD
  Lineage DAG is a heirarchy of dependencies of RDDs all the way upto th very first RDD	
  Lineage DAG is a logical plan on how to create the RDD.


     rddFile = sc.textFile(<filePath>, 4)	
     Lineage of rddFile: (4) rddFile -> textFile on <filePath>

     rddWords = rddFile.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(" "))
     Lineage of rddWords: (4) rddWords -> rddFile.flatMap -> textFile on <filePath>

     rddPairs = rddWords.map(lambda x: (x, 1))
     Lineage of rddPairs: (4) rddPairs -> rddWords.map -> rddFile.flatMap -> textFile on <filePath>

     rddWc = rddPairs.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)
     Lineage of rddWc: (4) rddWc -> rddPairs.reduceByKey -> rddWords.map -> rddFile.flatMap -> textFile on <filePath>


  Types of RDD Transformation
  ---------------------------

	Two types:

	 1. Narrow Transformations

           -> Narrow transformations are those, where the computation of each partition depends ONLY
              on its input partition.
           -> There is no shuffling of data.
           -> Simple and efficient


      	2. Wide Transformations

           -> In wide transformations, the computation of a single partition depends on many
              partitions of its input RDD.
           -> Data shuffle across partitions will happen.
           -> Complex and expensive


  RDD DAG Scheduling and Execution Flow
  -------------------------------------

      Application (created by a SparkContext)
	|
	|=> Jobs (each action command on an RDD lauches a job)
	    |
	    |=> Stages (one or more stages; each wide transformation create a new stage)
		|
		|=> Tasks ( set of transformations that can run in partition)
		    |
  		    |=> Transformations (that can run in parallel)


  RDD Persistence
  ---------------	
	rdd1 = sc.textFile( <file>, 4 )
	rdd2 = rdd1.t2(...)
	rdd3 = rdd1.t3(...)
	rdd4 = rdd3.t4(...)
	rdd5 = rdd3.t5(...)
	rdd6 = rdd5.t6(...)
	rdd6.persist( StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY )   ----> is an instruction to spark to save RDD partitions
	rdd7 = rdd6.t7(...)

	rdd6.collect()
	lineage of rdd6 : (4) rdd6 -> rdd5.t6 -> rdd3.t5 -> rdd1.t3 -> sc.textFile
		[sc.textFile, t3, t5, t6] -> collected to the driver

	rdd7.collect()   
	lineage of rdd6 : (4) rdd7 -> rdd6.t7 -> rdd5.t6 -> rdd3.t5 -> rdd1.t3 -> sc.textFile
		[t7] -> collected to the driver

	rdd6.unpersist()

	StorageLevels
	-------------
	MEMORY_ONLY	      -> default, Memory Serialized 1x Replicated
	MEMORY_AND_DISK	      -> Disk Memory Serialized 1x Replicated
	DISK_ONLY	      -> Disk Serialized 1x Replicated 	
	MEMORY_ONLY_2	      -> Memory Serialized 2x Replicated
	MEMORY_AND_DISK_2     -> Disk Memory Serialized 2x Replicated

	Commands
	--------
	rdd1.cache()      -> in-memory persistence
	rdd1.persist() 	  -> in-memory persistence
	rdd1.persist( StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY )

	rdd1.unpersist()


   Spark Executor Memory Structure
   -------------------------------
     
      Let us say we are requesting an executor with 10 GB RAM. 
      The spark job will be allocated executors with 10.3 GB (10GB + 300MB) RAM. 
     
      
      1. Reserved Memory (300 MB)
           -> Spark's internal usage
      
      2. Spark Memory (spark.memory.fraction: 0.6)   => 6 GB (Unified Memory)
          
         2.1  Execution Memory
                 -> Used for RDD partition creation and transformation
                 -> Can forcibly evict RDD partitions from storage memory if it requires
                    additional memory upto the quota allocated for it.

         2.2  Storage Memory (spark.memory.storageFraction: 0.5) => 3 GB
                 -> The RDD partitions and broadcast variables are persisted
                    in this memory.

      3. User Memory  => 4 GB
         -> Running non-spark related code execution. 
         -> Related to running python methods, storing python collection.

  RDD Transformations
  -------------------

  1. map		P: U -> V
			Object to Object transformation
			input RDD: N objects, output RDD: N objects
			
	 rdd2 = rdd1.map(lambda x: (x%5, x))


  2. filter		P: U -> Boolean
			Objects for which the function returns True will be in the output RDD
			input RDD: N objects, output RDD: <= N objects

	rddFile.filter(lambda x: len(x.split(" ")) > 8).collect()
	
				
  3. glom		P: None
			Return one list object per partition with all the objects of that partition.

		rdd1		rdd2 = rdd1.glom()
		P0: 3,2,1,4,5,6 -> glom -> P0: [3,2,1,4,5,6]
		P1: 5,6,7,8,9,3 -> glom -> P1: [5,6,7,8,9,3]
		P2: 4,7,6,2,1,0 -> glom -> P2: [4,7,6,2,1,0]

		rdd1.count() = 10 (int)    rdd2.count = 3 (list)

  4. flatMap		P: U -> Iterable[V]
			fatMap flattens the iterables produced by the function.

		rddWords = rddFile.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(" "))


  5. mapPartitions	P: Iterable[U] -> Iterable[V]
			partition to partition transformation

		rdd1.mapPartitions(lambda p: map(lambda x: x*10, p) ).collect()
		rdd1.mapPartitions(lambda p: [sum(p)] ).collect()


   Types of RDDs
   -------------
	-> Generaric RDDs : RDD[U]
	   Pair RDDs : RDD[(K, V)]


 6. mapValues		P: U -> V
			Applied only on Pair RDD
			Applies the function only to the 'value' part of the key-value pairs

		rddPairs.mapValues(lambda x: x*10).collect()
		-> In the above fn, x represents only the 'value' part of key-value pairs


  7. distinct		P: None, Optional: numPartition
			Returns distinct objects of the RDD.

		rddWords.distinct().collect()
