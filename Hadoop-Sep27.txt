   What is Big Data ?
   ------------------
  
    Refers to data that is large and complex data that is difficult to store and process
    using traditional data management tools or data processing technologies.

    Big Data Challenges:
	-> Storing huge amount of data
	-> Processing data faster
	-> Processing complex data

    What qualities of data make some data as Big Data ?   
	-> Volume  (10 TBs or PB scala data stores)
	-> Velocity (real time data processing)
	-> Variety (unstructured & semi-structured data)
	-> Veracity (data in doubt)
	-> Value (deep analytics)

   => Hadoop provides a solution to big data.


   What is a Cluster?
   ------------------		
        -> Is a unified entity comprising og many nodes whise cumulative resources (disk space, RAM, 
           CPU cores etc) can be used to distribute your storage and processing. 
  
   What is Hadoop ?
   ----------------
	Is an opensource framework for "storing" and "processing" big data on 
	"computing clusters" made of commodity machines. 

         1. HDFS   -> Hadoop Distributed File System
		   -> Distributed Storage Solution
		   -> Allows data of a single file to be distributed across many machines.
	
	 2. MapReduce -> Distributed Processing Framework
		    -> Used to distribute processing across many nodes in a cluster

	 3. YARN    -> Introduced in Hadoop 2 as a dedicated Resource Management Framework.


   
   HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
   -------------------------------------	

     -> Is a distributed storage framework

     -> Stores the data as blocks of 128 MB each.
 
      1. Name Node (NN)
		-> Is a master daemon (continuously running background job)
		-> Is a Java background process
		-> Receives "Block reports" from all the DNs
		-> The meta-data of the entire file system name space is maintained using 2 files.

		   1. FSImage
			-> Contains the state of the entire cluster from the boot time upto
			   the last check point

		   2. EditLog
			-> Contains current data (on going changes to the cluster) from the last check
			   point upto the current moment. 

      2. Data Node (DN)
		-> Is a slave daemon
		-> Runs on all the slave machines
		-> DNs send heart-beats to NNs once every 3 sec.
		   -> if three successive heart-beats are missed, NN marks the DN as dead. 
		-> DNs send "block report" to NN
		   -> 'Block Report' contains such information as:
			-> Total Disk Space
			-> Available Space
			-> Reserved Space
			-> List of all the files, blocks of the file, owner of the file, permissions,
			   Replication-factor, etc
			-> If it is a dircetory, owner, timestamp etc.
	
      3. Secondary Name Node (SNN)
		-> Is a master daemon	
	
      4. Balancer
	       -> Is a daemon that runs on the master (same machine as NN)
	       -> Maintains the replication-factor of the HDFS files.	


   Hadoop EcoSystem
   ----------------
	-> A set of tools that are commonly used for various data analytics, data flow,
           data ingestion use-cases on top of Hadoop.	   

    
   Hadoop Distributions
   --------------------
	-> Third-party Hadoop Distributions help you to install many of the commonly used
	   components of Hadoop very easily.

	-> They will provide cluster-access or image-copies (pre-intslled hard-disk files)
	   containing all the hadoop components pre-installed.

	Hardware Requirements:	
	  -> Minimum 8 GB for CDH 4.7 (old and light-weight)
	  -> Minimum 12 GB to 16 GB RAM is required for CDH 5.13 and above.
	
	On-Premesis Installation
	------------------------
	-> Cloudera
	-> HortonWorks (merged with cloudera)
	-> MapR

	Cloud Hadoop Clusters
	---------------------
	-> Amazon: EMR (Elastic MapReduce - AWS)
	-> Microsoft: HDInsights (Azure)
	-> Google: DataProc (GCP)
		

   Setup Hadoop On your Local Machine
   ----------------------------------
     -> You can use Cloudera "ImageCopy" (CDH) as a virtual machine.
	
	https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/release-notes/topics/cdh_vd_cdh_download.html

      -> Get any one CDH Quickstrat version.

      -> Download Oracle VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
	 (click on Windows Hosts)
	
      -> Follow the steps mentoned in the document shared with you.


   HDFS File Operations
   --------------------
     
      Linux File System  (local file system)
	-> Home Directory: /home/cloudera

      HDFS File System   (distributed file system)
	-> Home Directory: /user/cloudera  (hdfs://localhost.localdomain:8020/user/cloudera)

      Two command formats:
	
	-> hadoop fs -<command>
	-> hdfs dfs -<command>


      Common File Operations on HDFS
      ------------------------------

	List the files & directories:   
		
		hadoop fs -ls
		hdfs dfs -ls

		hdfs dfs -ls datasets
		hadoop fs -ls -R datasets    -> recursive listing

	Help
		hadoop fs -help
		hadoop fs -help stat

	Remove a files/directories:

		hadoop fs -rm <file-name>
		hadoop fs -rm dir1/*.txt
		hadoop fs -rm -R practice1    // remove non-empty directory		

	Create a directory:

		hadoop fs -mkdir demodir

	Delete an empty directory:

		hadoop fs -rmdir demodir

	Copy from one directory to other

		hadoop fs -cp <source> <destination>
		hadoop fs -cp practice1/NYSE_*.txt practice2

	To print the content of a file on stdout

		hadoop fs -cat wordcount_input.txt

	Move from one directory to other

		hadoop fs -mv practice1/NYSE_*.txt practice2/dir1

		
	Changing permissions on an HDFS file

		hadoop fs -chmod 777 practice1
		hadoop fs -chmod -R 777 practice1    // recursive permission


       Copy/Move files between Local File System and HDFS
       ---------------------------------------------------
	
	Copy from Linux to HDFS

	    -> hadoop fs -copyFromLocal datasets/NYSE_dividends.txt practice1
	    -> hadoop fs -put datasets/NYSE_daily.txt practice1

	    -> hadoop fs -put datasets practice1

       Copy from HDFS to Linux

	   -> hadoop fs -copyToLocal <hdfs-file-path> <linux-directory>
	   -> hadoop fs -get  <hdfs-file-path> <linux-directory>

       Move from Linux to HDFS
	
	   -> hadoop fs -moveFromLocal <linux-file-path> <hdfs-directory>
	      hadoop fs -moveFromLocal test1/baseball.txt practice2

   YARN  -- (Yet another resource negotiator)
====================================================

   1. Resource Manager
	-> Master daemon
	-> One per cluster
	-> receives job submissions and schedules jobs
	-> Allocates containers for Application masters
	-> Dynamically manages the resource allocation to all the jobs

   2. Node Manager
	-> Slave daemon
	-> One per node
	-> Sends heart-beats to RM
	-> reports the status of all the jobs/tasks running on that node to RM
	-> Launches App.Master for a job

   3. Application Master
	-> One instance per application
	-> manages the tasks related to a job on the cluster
	-> requests for resources required for the job

   4. Container    
	-> Multiple containers are allocated for a single application
	-> The actual tasks of a job are executed in these containers
	-> These containers communicates with the application master.

  ====================================================
      MapReduce
  ====================================================

   -> Hadoop's distributed processing framework. 
	
    MapReduce can be seen from two perspectives

    1. MapReduce Programming Paradigm	
	
		-> What kind of code that the developer has to write.	

		1. Driver Program
			-> All the configurations are defined here.

		2. Mapper Program
			-> Define the program logic to be implememted during the Map phase

		3. Reducer Program
			-> Optional
			-> It will reduce the various values of each unique key produced by the
			   mapper phase into aggregrated values with unique keys.
		
		4. Combiner Program
			-> Optional
			-> Will apply a min-reducer on the output of each mapper
			-> reduced the amount of data shuffled across the network there by increasing
			   the performance

		5. Partititoner Program
			-> Allows uds to define a custom partitioning logic to control which
			   data goes to which partition.
			-> Applied on the output of shuffle and sort phase.
	

	2. MapReduce Execution Model (Framework)	
		-> How the program is executed by the framework

		1. Mapper Phase
			-> Driver process lauches a set of mappers across the cluster
			   in the container allocated to it.

			-> All the mappers execute the same code.

			-> All the mapper write (k,v) pairs to context-buffer from which
			   a lot of local intermediate files are generated (across the cluster)

		2. Combiner Phase
			-> Optional phase
			-> Applied to the output of every map instance.

		3. Shuffle & Sort Phase
			-> Collect all the intermediate data and group the data by keys
			   (i.e it will produce unique keys with grouped values)
				(key, [val1, val2, val3, ....])

			-> Number of partitions are created with this shuffled data.
			   The number of partitions are equal to the number of reducers. 
			   (the default number of reducers = 1)

		4. Partitioning Phase
			-> Optional Phase
			-> A custom partitioner can be applied to decide which keys go to which
			   partition.

		5. Reducer Phase
			-> All these partitions are then processed by the reducer and the
			   output the reducer is written to HDFS in a specified directory.

			-> The number of output files is equal to the number of reducers.

      Submit an MR Program to the Cluster (YARN Resource Manager)
      -----------------------------------------------------------
	  $hadoop jar /home/cloudera/mrpractice.jar com.sample.WordCountJob wordcount_input.txt wcout
	  $yarn jar /home/cloudera/mrpractice.jar com.sample.WordCountJob wordcount_input.txt wcout	  


      Input Split
      -----------
	-> Always has whole number of records
		-> record in atext file is a line (ending with \n)

	-> InputSplits are created from the blocks where where InputSplit
	   starts at a new record and ends at a record boundary

	-> InputSplits are given as input data to the mappers.

	InputFormat  -> Identified the records and creates InputSpits
	InpuSplit    -> One intergral number of records that could span multple blocks
     	RecordReader -> Creates a (K, V) pair from each record of the inputsplit
	             -> RecordReader calles the map() method with each (K, V) pair

    Creating a MapReduce Program from Scratch
    -----------------------------------------
	
	Two approaches: 

	1. Adding the required dependent jars from your local installation.

		-> Create a blank Java Project
		-> Add the following libraries in the build-path
		   
                    Right Click on Project -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path

		    Go to Libraries Tab -> Add External Jars
			-> /usr/lib/hadoop/hadoop-common.jar
			-> /user/lib/hadoop-0.20-mapreduce/hadoop-core.jar

		-> Start writing your MR code

	2. Using maven (package manager) you can add dependencies from maven-repo.

 
   Mapper Life Cycle Methods
   -------------------------
	
	1. setup
		-> executed once at the beginning of the mapper.
		-> perform initializations.

	2. map
		-> invoked once for every record, after setup() method
		-> runs as many times as the records in the input-split

	3. cleanup
		-> executed once after map() is completed.
		-> cleanup the resources (close the connections)

	4. run
		-> To gain complete control of execution-flow


   Reducer Life Cycle Methods
   ---------------------------
	
	1. setup
		-> executed once at the beginning of the reducer.
		-> perform initializations.

	2. reduce
		-> invoked once for every record, after setup() method.
		-> runs as many times as the records in the partition.

	3. cleanup
		-> executed once after reduce() is completed.
		-> cleanup the resources (close the connections)

	4. run
		-> To gain complete control of execution-flow


   Hadoop Writable Data Types
    ---------------------------

	-> Hadoop uses its own data types which are optimizes for serialization and deserialization.
	-> All Hadoop API classes work with Hadoop data types only.
	
	Java		Hadoop
	----		------
	String		Text
	Int		IntWritable
	Double		DoubleWritable
	Long		LongWritable
	Bool		BoolWritable
	Null		NullWritable

	
   Use-case
   --------
   From facebook.tsv dataset, fetch the record with highest "likes_received" from among the people
   who are born between 1990 and 2000.

    Two MR programs :

    1. fetch all the records with dob_year between 1990 and 2000  		    => age
    2. fetch the record with max value of likes_received from the output of step 1  => max-likes

  ==============================================
     Hive
  ==============================================

     -> Distributed Data Warehousing Infrastructure built on top of Hadoop.
     -> Provides an SQL interface for analysts to analyse big data on Hadoop.
     -> Hive uses MapReduce as its execution engine.
     -> Hive generates MR programs for the user queries and runs them on Hadoop cluster.

        NOTE: Hive is not an RDBMS database
	      Hive is not a NoSQL database


     Working with Hive
   
	1. Using CLI

		-> Hive Shell (connects to the local hive)
		-> Beeline Shell (connects to hive using JDBC drive - secure)

	2. Using HUE (Beeswax interface)
		-> provides WebUI to send queries to Hive

	3. Using Client Application
	

    Hive Warehouse
    --------------
	-> Directory where hive stores all data files of managed tables. 
	-> default path:  /user/hive/warehouse

    Hive Metastore
    --------------
	-> Is an external servive using which Hive manages its metadata (table schemas)
	-> In production deployments, we use MySQL/PostgreSQL as metastore 
	-> Hive comes with an embedded matastore called "Derby"

		
   NOTES
   -----
	-> Hive does not support primary-key and foreign-key
	-> Hive does not support update and delete ops on regular managed tables.

   Databases / Schemas
   -------------------
	show databases;
	show schemas;

	drop database <database-name>;  // drop an empty database
	
	create database ctsdb1;
	create database hivedb1 location '/user/cloudera/hivedb/hivedb1.db';

	describe database hivedb1;

   Describe
   --------

	describe <table-name>;
	desc <table-name>;

	describe extended <table-name>;
	describe formatted <table-name>;

   Table
   ------
	
	CREATE TABLE empinfo (empid INT, empname STRING, salary DOUBLE, deptid SMALLINT)
	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
	FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
	LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
	STORED AS TEXTFILE;

	defaults:

	default storage format:  TEXTFILE
	default line terminator: "\n"
	default field terminator: Ctrl-A  (\0001)
	

   Loading Data
   -------------

   => local file system
   
        File is "copied" from the local file system to hive warehouse

	-- append
	LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/cloudera/hive/Hive/data/emp.txt' INTO TABLE empinfo;

	--overwrite
	LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/cloudera/hive/Hive/data/emp.txt' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE empinfo;

   => hdfs file system
   
        File is "moved" from the linux file system to hive warehouse

	-- append
	LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/cloudera/hive/data/emp.txt' INTO TABLE empinfo;

	--overwrite
	LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/cloudera/hive/data/emp.txt' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE empinfo;

   
   Managed Tables
   ---------------
	-> Tables that are managed by Hive (created in hive warehouse directory)
	-> When you drop the table both data files as well as schema are deleted.


   External Tables
   ---------------
	-> Tables are created in custom location specified in the create command
	-> When you drop the table, ONLY schema is dropped. The data files are NOT dropped.


   Partitioned Tables
   ------------------
	
	=> Allows you to organize your table data into multiple partitions (separate directories) based
	   on unique values of one or more partition columns.
	
       From the way data is written to partition tables, we can think of two types of partitioning:

	1. Static Partitioning
	    -> When you know into which partition you load data, then you can use static partitioning
	       approach.
	    -> To load data you may use LOAD DATA command or INSERT..SELECT command


	2. Dynamic Partitioning  

	    -> When your data file contains records that belong to multiple partitions and you can't

	=> row level sampling -> Fetch some number of rows from every block


  Bucket Sampling: Fetches minimum 1 bucket

     	=> SELECT * FROM students_part_bk TABLESAMPLE (BUCKET 2 OUT OF 3 ON id) 
  	=> SELECT * FROM students_buckets TABLESAMPLE (BUCKET 1 OUT OF 2 ON id) 

  Block Sampling:  Fetches minimum 1 block

  	=> SELECT * FROM students TABLESAMPLE (50 PERCENT)
	=> SELECT * FROM students TABLESAMPLE (5M)  // 4 blocks

  Row Sampling:  Fetches n rows from each input split

  	=> SELECT * FROM students TABLESAMPLE (5 ROWS)

  immutable tables & transactional tables
===================================================

Using Table properties

STORED AS TEXTFILE 
TBLPROPERTIES ('creator'='raju', 'created_at'='2020-03-01 10:00:00')

 Immutable tables
 -----------------

As of Hive 0.13.0, a table can be made immutable by creating it with 
TBLPROPERTIES ("immutable"="true"). 

The default is "immutable"="false".

INSERT INTO behavior into an immutable table is disallowed if any data is already present, 
although INSERT INTO still works if the immutable table is empty. 

The behavior of INSERT OVERWRITE is not affected by the "immutable" table property.

An immutable table is protected against accidental updates due to a script loading data 
into it being run multiple times by mistake. The first insert into an immutable table 
succeeds and successive inserts fail, resulting in only one set of data in the table, 
instead of silently succeeding with multiple copies of the data in the table.

  How to run a script file in Hive
------------------------------------
 NOTE: Run this from command prompt (not from within the shell)

  hive -f '/home/cloudera/hive/Hive/churn_modelling.hql'

----------------------------------------------
 Running Hive commands in interactive mode
----------------------------------------------
 NOTE: Run this from command prompt (not from within the shell)
 
  hive -e 'select * from ctsdb1.empinfo'

 =========================================
    Impala
 =========================================

   -> A sql query engine built using Massivly parallel processing (MPP) query engine
   -> For processing huge amount of data (PB scala) stored in Hadoop clusters (HDFS)
   -> Uses the same metastore as well as the warehouse as that of Hive
   -> Uses the same query language as that of Hive (Hive QL)
   -> Written in C++ & Java
   -> High performance and Low Latency.
   -> Supports in-memory data processing.  
   -> Developed by Cloudera
	-> Shipped with all major Hadoop managed cloud service providers.


    "invalidate metadata" command
     -----------------------------
	-> To refresh any metatdata changes happened outside impala, you need to run "invalidate metadata"
           command to refresh the local metadata of impala.

   When to use impala ?
   --------------------

	-> Impala is not fault-tolerant because of in-memory computation
	   -> If any of the servers/nodes running impala queries fail, the job will be aborted 
	-> Hence impala is not suitable for long-running jobs. 
	-> Use impala for short queries (random access of data etc.)

        => Impala is good for real time quries
	   Hive is good for large batch-jobs

     NOTE: 
	=> invalidate metadata
		-> To refresh any metatdata changes happened outside impala, you need to 
		   run "invalidate metadata" command to refresh the local metadata of impala.

	=> refresh <tablename>

		-> Whenever table data changes outside of impala, you need to use 
		   "refresh <tablename>" to get the latest data.

	-> Impala does not support "LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH .." command


 =========================================
    Sqoop
 =========================================

   -> Structured data ingestion tool.

   -> Used to import data from RDBMS databases to Hadoop (HDFS/Hive)
      Used to export data from Hadoop (HDFS/Hive) to external RDBMS databases.

   -> Sqoop launches "map-only" jobs to import data parallellly from an RDBMS into HDFS.

 ==============================
       HBase
 ==============================

   -> HBase is a NoSQL / NOn-relational database
   -> Provides a transactional data processing facility built on top of HDFS

   -> HBase is created based on "Google Big Table" architecture.


   What are short-comings of RDBMS databases
   -----------------------------------------
	=> Does not provide unlimited scalability (because they are not distributed databases)
	=> Does not support schema evolution.

   What are NoSQL databases
   ------------------------
	-> Are created as distributed databases that run on a cluster.
	   -> Hence offer unlimited scalability
	-> Does not follow SQL like regid schemas. They offer schema evolutions by following 
	   non-relational model.
	-> They use denormalized tables so that joins can be completly avoided.


   Types of NoSQL databases
   ------------------------
	1. Wide Column or Column Family orietented databases  (ex: Hbase, Cassandra )
	2. Document oriented databases (ex: MongoDB, CouchDB)
	3. Key-Value Stores (ex: Redis, DynamoDB )
	4. Graph Database (ex: Neo4J)


   HBase Data Model
   ----------------

	-> A table definition contains only table name and column families.
	-> The data belonging to each column-family is physically stored in one place.
	-> each column belongs to one column family.
	-> A row can have as many columns as needed.
	   -> Each row is identified by a row-id.
	-> HBase manitains multiple versions of each cell
	   -> The number of versions to keep is configured at column-family level

   HBase and RDBMS
   ---------------
	-> HBase does not suppot SQL
	-> HBase only supports a basic set of operations (CRUD) on a single-row
		-> All operations are applied at row-level
		-> No JOINs, No Grouping, No Sub-Queries
	-> Denormalized
	-> Uses column-oriented storage
		-> HBase table more like a multi-map than an RDBMS table
	-> Limited ACID supports
		-> ACID complaint at row-level only.

	-> Lot of common DB operations are not supported in HBASE
		-> No JOINS
		-> No GroupBy, No aggregation.
		-> No OrderBy
		-> No Sub-Queries

HBase Operations

    Apache KAFKA
 ======================================
   
  -> Opensource distributed event streaming platform
 
     Event Streaming
     ---------------
	-> processing data in "real-time"

	-> Capturing data from event sources like DBs, Sensors, Mobile devices, Cloud Service and
           software applications in the form of streams of events. 

        -> Event streams enable continous flow and interpretation of data. 

        Some Use Cases:
	
	-> Processing payments and transactions in real-time 
	   (stock exchanges, banks, insurance etc..)
	-> Track an montitor cars, trucks in real time (logistics & automotive)
	-> Capture and analyze sensor data from IoT devices (such as in factories, hospitals)
	-> To collect and immediatly react to customer orders (retails, hotels, travels, uber/ola)


    Messaging Systems
    -----------------
	-> A messaging system is a system that is used to transfer data from one application to 
           another, so that application can focus on data and not on how to share it. 

	1. Point-to-point (Queues) -> only one consumer per event
	2. Publisher/Subscriber (pubsub) -> events are not intended for any consumer. 

   
    What is Kafka ?
    ---------------

	Is a distributed streaming platform that is used for:

	1. Publish & subscripe streams of events
	2. Store streams of events in a fault-tolerant way
	3. Process streams of events as they occus (real-time processing APIs)
		
   
   Kafka Building Blocks
   ---------------------

	1. Broker 
		-> Are the nodes on which Kafka service is running
		-> Responsible for storing published data.
		-> Each broker is stateless, so they use "Zookeeper" for maintaining state.
		-> each broker may have zero or more partitions per topic.

		NOTE: Broker-ID must be unique in a cluster

	2. Zookeeper
		-> Used for maintaining and coordinating Kafka brokers
		-> ZK is used to notify producers and consumers about the presence of any
		   new broker in the cluster.

	3. Topics & Logs
		-> Is a feed/category to which records are published by producers and are
                   consumed by consumers.
		-> For every topic Kafka maintains partition-logs (distributed commit log)

	4. Partitions
		-> A topic is organized as partitions allowing kafka to handke arbitrary amount 
		   of data
		-> each partition is an "ordered commit log"

	5. Partition-offset
		-> Each message in a topic-partition has a unique sequence id called "offset".

	6. Replicas
		-> Backups of the partition.
		-> Used to prevent data loss
		-> Only one replica is designated as the "Leader replica"
			-> All writes & reads are served ONLY by leader replicas. 
			-> When the broker which contains a leader-replicas goes down, one the existing
			   follower replicas will be elected as the leader. 

	7. Producers
		-> External application that write messages to various partitions (leader replicas) 
		   of a topic
		-> A single producer can write to any number of topics.

	8. Consumers
		-> Application that subscribe to one or more topics, poll the messages and process
		   the messages.
			

   Getting started with Kafka
   --------------------------

     1. Make sure you are running Java 8 (JDK 1.8.x). If not, make sure you upgrade to Java 8.
		https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-java-8-on-centos-7/

		NOTE: To check the current version of Java, run the following command:
		$ java -version

     2. Download Kafka from  https://kafka.apache.org/downloads
	  -> Download the binary ( such as  kafka_2.12-2.6.1.tgz )
	  -> Extract it to a suitable location. 

	Important Directories:
	---------------------
	 -> <kafka>/bin    : You have all the tools/services here
	 -> <kafka>/config : All configuration files are located here   
	 -> <kafka>/libs   : All Kafka API libraries (jar file) are location	


  Let start working with Kafka
  ----------------------------

	1. Start the zookeeper service.
		-> Zookeeper runs on port 2181 (by default)
	
		To check if zookeeper is running or not, use the following command:
		$netstat -nlp | grep 2181

		Starting zookeeper service:
		$<kafka>/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

	2. Start Kafka broker.
	
		-> Kafka broker, by default, runs on port 9092

		$<kafka>/bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

		Important Confog Properties:

		1. broker.id=0
		2. listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092
		3. log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs
		4. zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181
		5. log.retention.hours=168

	3. Working with Topics
	   
		1. List the existing topics

			bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list

		2, Describe a topic

			bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --topic ctstopic1

		3. Delete a topic
		
			bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --delete --topic ctstopic1

		4. Create a topic

			bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic demotopic1 --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1

	4. Launch a Console Producer

		bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic demotopic1
		
		bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 
					      --topic demotopic1
					      --property "parse.key=true" 
					      --property "key.separator=:"
	
	5. Launch a Console Consumer

		bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic demotopic1
		
		bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 
					      --topic demotopic1 
					      --property print.key=true 
					      --property print.value=true 
                                              --property key.separator=" | "


		bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 
					      --topic demotopic1
					      --partition 0
					      --offset 0

		bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic demotopic1
					--bootstrap-server localhost:9092 
					--group g1


	6. Consumer Groups

		bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list



   What a message can have?
   ------------------------
	-> topic (required)
	-> value (required)  
	-> key (optional, but always used)
	-> partition-id (optional)
	-> timestamp (optional)
	

   Message Distribution Logic in Kafka
   ------------------------------------

	1. If the message has a partition-id specified, then the message is sent to that partition. 

	2. If the message has no partition-id specified, then

		2.1 If the message has a key specified, then the hashcode of the key is mapped
		    to a specific partition (using hash partitioning logic)

		2.2 If the message does not have any key, then, the messages are distributed randomly
		    across partitions in aload balanced manner.


    Single Node, Multiple Broker Setup
    -----------------------------------
      
     -> Create three different copies of server.properties file and modify the following setting:

				broker.id	listeners			log.dirs			     
	
	server.properties	0		---				/tmp/kafka-logs		
	server1.properties      1		listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9093	/tmp/kafka-logs-1
	server2.properties      2		listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9094	/tmp/kafka-logs-2


   Consumers - Standalone Consumer & Consumer Groups  
   --------------------------------------------------

    Standalone consumer is a consumer that consumes messages from all the partitions of a topic
    or from a one (or more) partitions

    NOTE: Having a lot of partitions for a topics allows us to launch multiple instances of
	  standalone consumers, each consuming from 1 partition, there by allowing us to
	  increase consumer side scalability. 
	
	
   Consumer Groups
   ---------------
	-> One or more consumer instances subscribing to the same topic using the same group-id form
	   a 'consumer group'
	-> The partitions of the topics are distributed to the consumers in the consumer group.
    
        Partition Rebalance
	-------------------
	-> Changing the ownership of partitions among the existing consumers in the group is 
	   called 'rebalance'
	-> Rebalance happens automatically when a new consumer joins a group or an existing
           consumer leaves a group.
	

   Kafka APIs
   ----------
 	-> Kafka APIs allows us to write client applications that interact with Kafka
	
	1. Producer API   -> to write producer application
	2. Consumer API	  -> to write consumer application
	3. Streams API	  -> to write streaming data processing application that read data from topics,
			     transform/filter/enrich the data and write to some other topics.
	4. Connect API	  -> to write cusom source connectors and sink connectors
			     source conncetor -> apllication that writes to a Kafka topic
			     sink connector -> reads from a kafka topic and writes to a custom application.

   Producer API
   ------------

    -> Writing a simple Producer Application using Kafka Producer API
	
	1. Define the properties object where you define all the desired properties. 
	
		-> bootstrap.servers 
		-> key.serializer
		-> value.serializer		

		 Properties kafkaProps = new Properties();
	      	 kafkaProps.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092,localhost:9093,localhost:9094");
	      	 kafkaProps.put("key.serializer","org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");         
	      	 kafkaProps.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");

	2. Define the "KafkaProducer" object
		-> defines a connection to the cluster

		Producer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(kafkaProps);

	3. Define you messages using "ProducerRecord" objects
		ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>(topicName, key, value); 


	4. Send the ProducerRecord using "KafkaProducer.send( ProducerRecord )" method.


       Sample Program:


	    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        	   
	      String topicName = "demotopic3p3r";
		  
	      Properties kafkaProps = new Properties();
	      kafkaProps.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092,localhost:9093,localhost:9094");
	      kafkaProps.put("key.serializer","org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");

    ProducerRecord
    --------------
	-> Represents Kafka message 

	ProducerRecord(String topic, V value)
	ProducerRecord(String topic, K key, V value)
	ProducerRecord(String topic, Integer partition, K key, V value)
	ProducerRecord(String topic, Integer partition, Long timestamp, K key, V value)


   Ways to Send Messages to Kafka
   ------------------------------

    NOTE: Producer.send() -> returns Future<RecordMetaData>

	1. Fire and Forget
		-> You send the messages continuously, but do not wait for the acks.

		Advantages:
		-> very fast
	
		Disadvantage:
		-> You don't know of the record fails. 
		-> record delivery order is not guaranteed

		Use-case
		-> Non-critical applications such as click-stream analysis

	2. Synchronous Messaging
		-> We block the Future using get() method and waut until the RecordMetaData is returned.
			RecordMetadata metaData = producer.send(record).get();

		Advantages
		-> We know about what happened to the record
		-> record delivery order is guaranteed

		Disadvantage:
		-> Slow (because it has to wait for the ack)

		Use-Cases:
		-> Critical applications such as credir-card transactions.	

	3. Asynchrounous Messaging
		-> We attach a callback method to the send request
		-> The callback method is invoked when the Future eventually returns.

		Advantages:
		-> very fast
		-> We know about what happened to the record
	
		Disadvantage:
		-> record delivery order is not guaranteed

		Use-Cases:
		-> Critical applications where message order may not be important. 


   Producer Configurations
   ------------------------
	1.   bootstrap.servers  (required)
	2.   key.serializer  	(required)
	3.   value.serializer  	(required)

	4.   acks   (acknowledgements)
	      -> The number of acknowledgements the producer requires the leader to have
		 received before considering a request as complete.
		
		acks -> 0, 1 (default), all (-1)

		acks: 0    -> no acks at all
		acks: 1    -> only leader acks
		acks: all  -> all ISRs must acknowledge.   (Safe Producer)
				-> ONLY this can prevent message loss

	5. buffer.memory	(def: 32MB in bytes)
	6. batch.size		(def: 16KB in bytes)
	7. compression.type	(default: none) -> none, gzip, snappy, lz4, zstd
	8. retries		(default: no limit)
				-> controlled by "delivery.timeout.ms" (2 min - 120000)
	9.  delivery.timeout.ms	(default: 120000)
	10. max.block.ms	(default: 60000)
	11. linger.ms		(default: 5)
	12. partitioner.class	(custom partition)

	
     Consumer API
     ------------

	1. Define the properties object.	

		Properties props = new Properties();
		props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092,localhost:9093,localhost:9094");		
		props.put("key.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
		props.put("value.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");		
		props.put("group.id", "demo");

	2. Define the KafkaConsumer object

		Consumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);

	3. Subscribe to one or more topics.
		consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList(topicName));

	4. Create a poll loop   (infinite loop)  

	5. Within the loop, send a poll request.
            -> The poll returns a 'ConsumerRecords' object, which is a collection of 'ConsumerRecord' objects
            -> Loop through the 'ConsumerRecords' collection and process the messages.

		
    Kafka Delivery Semantics for Consumers
    --------------------------------------
   
      1. At most once
	
	 -> The offsets are committed as soon as the messages are received. 
	 -> If the processing goes wrong, the messages will be lost and will not be read again.

      2. At least once  (default)

	-> Offsets are committed after the messages are processed.
	-> If the processing goes wrong, the messages that were already processed may also be
	   reprocessed again.

      3. Exactly once
	
	-> Is not supported in Kafka -> Sink workloads. (consumer API)


    AutoCommit Vs Manual Commit
    ---------------------------

	When "enable.auto.commit" is set to "true" (default is "true"), Kafka automatically
	commits the offset and then poll the next batch of messages. This follow "atleast once"
	semantics approach. 

	If you set "enable.auto.commit" to "false", we have to programmatically commit the offsets
	using consumer.commitSync() or consumer.commitAsync() methods.

  
    Important Consumer Configurations
    ---------------------------------
	-> bootstrap.server (required)
	-> key.deserializer
	-> value.deserializer
	-> group.id (if you are launching in a consumer groups)

	
	1. enable.auto.commit   (default: true)
		-> Kafka automatically takes care of committing the offset.

	2. fetch.min.bytes (def: 1)
		-> The minimum amount of data to poll in each request.

	3. max.poll.records (def: 500)
		-> max. how many message to receive per poll request.
		-> increase this, if the messages are small and if have lot of RAM

	4. max.partitions.fech.bytes (def: 1 MB in bytes)
		-> max data returned by the broker per partition
		-> if you read from 100 partitions, you need 100MB RAM for the client app.

	5. fetch.max.bytes (def: 50 MB)
		-> max data returned for each fetch request (covers all partitions)

	6. heartbeat.intervel.ms (def: 3000)
		-> specific to consumer groups (group managemet facility)
		-> time interval at which heartbeats are expected to be sent to coordinator broker.

	7. session.timeout.ms (def: 10000)
		-> Timeout used to detect client failures. 

	8. auto.offset.reset
		-> latest (default), earliest, none

		-> what should happen when the current-offset is not set or is invalid.

		
    Streams API
    -----------

	1. Define the properties.

		Properties props = new Properties();
             	props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        	props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_KEY_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass().getName());
        	props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_VALUE_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass().getName());

	2. Create a StreamBuilder object.

		 StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

	3. Define the topology on the streambuilder (entire functionality)

		
        	KStream<String, String> source = builder.stream(
        	    "wordcount-input", 
        	    Consumed.with( Serdes.String(), Serdes.String() )
        	);

        	KTable<String, Long> counts = source
            		.flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.split(" ")))
            		.groupBy((key, value) -> value)
            		.count();
        
        	// need to override value serde to Long type
        	counts.toStream().to("wordcount-output", Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long()));


	4. Define the KafkaStreams object using the builder and propertier. 

		final KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), props);

	5. start the KStreams..
		
		streams.start()

 =========================================
     NiFi - Workflow Scheduler
 =========================================
     
     => NiFi ---> Niagara Files

     => Uses a Web UI and runs on a WebServer (Jetty)

     => Apache NiFi supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data-routing, transformations,
	and can define mediation logic.

     => Automate the flow of data between systems:
				
	=> JSON  -> Databases
	=> FTP   -> Hadoop
	=> Kafka -> ElasticSearch 
	
     => Drag & Drop Interface

     => Focus on Configuration of Processors
	
     => Scalabale across a cluster of machine
	   -> NiFi cluster are small clusters (typically 10 to 15 nodes)
	   -> Each machine is very high config with LOTs & LOTs of disk space.

     => Manage Data Buffering & Back Pressure management etc

    NiFi is good at:	
     	=> Reliable and secure transfer of data between systems
	=> Delivery of data from various sources and analytics platforms
	=> For enrichment & preparation data.

    NiFi is not good at
	=> Distributed Computing
	=> Complex Data Procesing
		-> Joins, rolling windows, aggregations etc.


   Getting Started with NiFi
   -------------------------

    Installing NiFi is very straight forward
	
	-> Download NiFi bianaries as a tar or zip file
	   URL: https://nifi.apache.org/download.html

	-> Extract the downloaded archive into a suitable folder

    => Let us assume that NiFi is installed in a directory called "nifi-1.12.1" 

  
   Starting the NiFi
   -----------------

   1. cd nifi-1.12.1

   2. For Windows Users
	-> For Windows users, navigate to the folder where NiFi was installed. 
        -> Within this folder is a subfolder named "bin". 
        -> Navigate to this and double-click the "run-nifi.bat" file.
	-> This will launch NiFi and leave it running in the foreground.
        -> To shut down NiFi, select the window that was launched and Ctrl+C

   3. For Linux/Mac OS X users
	-> $ bin/nifi.sh run     (to start NiFi app in the foreground)
        -> $ bin/nifi.sh status  (to get the status)

   4. Installing NiFi as a service
	-> This is supported only for Linux / Mac

	-> $ bin/nifi.sh install    
             -> This will install with the default service name 'nifi'

        -> $ bin/nifi.sh install dataflow
             -> This will install with the custom service name 'dataflow'

        -> Once installed, the service can be started and stopped as below:
	     -> $ sudo service nifi start    (or sudo service dataflow start)
		$ sudo service nifi stop
		$ sudo service nifi status


   Opening NiFi Web UI
   -------------------

     => Goto:   http://localhost:8080/nifi

     => The port can be changed by editing the nifi.properties file in the NiFi conf directory
     => The default port is 8080.



     Basic Concepts
     --------------

	1. Flow File
		-> It is basically the data
		-> Comprises of
			1. Content -> the data itself
			2. Attributes -> (K, V) pairs assciated with the data.
		-> Persisted on the disk.

	2. Processor 
		-> There are ~288 processors in version 1.12
		-> Applies a set of transformations and rules to flow-files to generate
	           new flow files.
		-> Any processor can process any flow file.
		-> Processors are passing flowfile references to each other to 
		   advance the data processing.
		-> They are all running in parallel on different threads.

	3. Connector
		-> Its basically a queue of all the flow files that are yet to be processed
		   by the downstream processor.
		-> Defines rules about how flow files are proritized
		-> Can define backpressure to avoid overflow.

	4. Process Groups
		-> A container ofr defining a group of processors.

	5. Controller Services
		-> Different services provides by NiFi to help with data manipulations
		-> The controlers can be define at Global scope (NiFi) or at process group 
		   scope
			

   Use-Cases-1  ==> CSV files to MySQL  
   ------------------------------------      

       -> GetFile (Source Data - CSV file)
	  -> SplitText (splits single FF into many FFs)
            -> ConvertRecord (Convert CSV into JSON FF)               
	       -> ConvertJSONtoSQL (Convert JSON to SQL statement)
                   -> PutSQL (to run SQL against MySQL)

     Configurations
     --------------

     Processor 1: GetFile
		-> Input Directory: source directory where you put CSV files

	GetFile  -> success -> SplitText

     Processor 2: SplitText
		-> Line Split Count: 1
		   Header Line Count: 1

	SplitText -> splits -> ConvertRecord

     Processor 3: ConvertRecord
		-> RecordReader: CSVReader (Controller Service)
		-> RecordWriter: JSONRecordSetWriter (Controller Service)

	CSVReader Properties
	-> Schema Access Strategy: Use String Fields From Header
	   Treat First Line As Header: true

	JSONRecordSetWriter Properties
	-> No changes
	
	ConvertRecord -> success -> ConvertJSONToSQL
	  
     Processor 4: ConvertJSONToSQL	  
	-> JDBCConnectionPool: DBCPConnectionPool (Controller Service)
	   Statement Type: INSERT
	   Table Name: <MySQL Table Name>
	   Catalog Name: <MYSQL Database Name>

	DBCPConnectionPool properties   
	-> Database Connection URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<mysql db name>
	   Database Driver Class Name: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
           Database Driver Locations: <directory path where you placed the mysql driver>
		    (ex: /home/cloudera/nifi-1.11.4/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.44.jar)
	   Database User: <mysql user name>
	   Database password: <mysql user password>

       ConvertJSONToSQL -> sql -> PutSQL 

     Processor 5: PutSQL  
	-> JDBCConnectionPool: DBCPConnectionPool (Controller Service)


   Use-Case-2
   ----------
     ==> Kafka - NiFi Integration
 
       -> GenerateFlowFile (Generates random Flow Files at the desired)
          -> PublishKafka (Publishes Flow Files to a Kafka Topic)

       -> ConsumeKafka (Subscribes to Kafka topic and created flow-file)
          -> LogAttribute (LOg the flow files) 
 

     Configurations
     --------------

     Processor 1: GenerateFlowFile
     -> File Size: 100B
	Batch Size: 5
	Unique Flow Files: true

	GenerateFlowFile -> success -> PublishKafka_0_10 1.11.4

     Processor 2: PublishKafka_0_10 1.11.4
     -> Kafka Brokers: localhost:9092
	Topic Name: <kafka topic name>   ex: nifi-topic


    NOTE: No connection between PublishKafka_0_10 1.11.4 & ConsumeKafka_0_10 1.11.4


    Processor 3: ConsumeKafka_0_10 1.11.4
     -> Kafka Brokers: localhost:9092
	Topic Name: <kafka topic name>   ex: nifi-topic
	
	ConsumeKafka_0_10 1.11.4 -> success -> LogAttribute

    Processor 4: LogAttribute
    -> No changes



   NiFi Repositories
   -----------------

   1. Flow Repository
	-> Stores the current state (content & attributes) of each flow file.

   2. Content Repository
	-> Contains all the content present in all flow files of NiFi
        -> This directory uses large disk space

   3. Provenance Repository   
	-> Tracks and stores all the events of all the flowfiles in NiFi.
