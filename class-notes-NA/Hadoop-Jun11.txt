 Pre-requisites
 --------------
	-> SQL
	-> Java
	-> Python

 ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
  
   Big Data
   --------
    
   - Type of data which large and complex that your traditional data processing systems
     can not reasonably store and process. 

   Big Data scenarios
   ------------------
       -> The volume to be handled is very high (much higher than 1 TB)
       -> You want to support real-time analytics (velocity)
       -> You data is growing very fast, so that in no time your system becomes inadeqaute. 
       -> Process unstructures, semi-structured data etc.
    
  Big Data Characteristics
  ------------------------
       -> Volume
       -> Velocity
       -> Variety 
       -> Veracity (correctness of the data)
       -> Value (extracting insights from the data)       

  Why your traditional systems have big data problem
  --------------------------------------------------
   -> Because your traditional systems ( that exists in pre-internet era ) are not designed
      for internet scale applications.
 
   -> They are designed to run on a single machine. The single machine has only limited 
      amount of resources.


  Scalability Options
  -------------------
    -> Scale up  (Vertical Scaling)   -> Migrate to a machine with higher configuration
    -> Scala out (Horizontal Scaling) -> Use many machines instead of one. 
                                      -> Use computing cluster

   What is a Computing Cluster?
   ----------------------------
   A unified network of nodes (machines) whose cumulative resources can be used to store
   or process data as if you working with a single machine. 

   
   What is a Framework ?
   ---------------------
    A framework is a set of libraries that implement all the basic low-level functionalities
    that the framework is intended for. The users of the framework should focus on the 
    business-logic and implement their solutions as per the guidelines provided by the 
    framework. 


    What is the solution to storage & processing problems associated with Big Data
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    -> Hadoop provides a solution for big-data problems.

 
    What is Hadoop ?
    ----------------     
    Hadoop is a Open Source Framework to Store and Process data in a distributed way 
    using a cluster of commdity harware. 

     -> Provides two things:
	   -> Distributed Storage Solution (HDFS)
	   -> Distributed Processing Solution (MapReduce)
        And also,
           -> Resource Management (YARN)


    Hadoop Distributions
    --------------------
	Apache Hadoop => Open source	
	On-Prem & Hybrid Cloud => Cloudera & MapR
	Managed Cloud Solutions 
		-> AWS   : AWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR)
		-> Azure : HDInsights
	        -> GCP   : DataProc 


    HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
    --------------------------------------

      -> Stores data in the form of "blocks" of 128 MB each
      -> Each block is replicated on other nodes so many times as defined by a 'replication-factor'
           (default rep-factor is 3)      
      
     Q1:  If I want to stote 1024 MB (1 GB) file on HDFS, how much physical storage space 
          is required (using default configs) => 3 GB   

     Q2:  If you want to store 1034 MB file, how many unique blocks are created on HDFS?
	  -> 8 blocks of 128MB each & 1 block of 10 MB
         
     
    MapReduce (Distributed Processing Solution)
    --------------------------------------------
   
     -> MR is a distributed processing solution where a "map" task is launched on small chuck
        of data (like a block) on HDFS. 
     -> All these "map" tasks produce intermediate files (results of map tasks).
     -> All these intermediate files are shuffled (collected from multiple machines) and sorted.        
     -> This shuffled data is sent to "reducer" program/task
     -> "reducer" task will aggregate the results and write them as final output on HDFS. 


   Hadoop EcoSystem
   ----------------   
     -> Refers to a set of tools/frameworks/software that run on top of hadoop to solve
        various big data related problems.          

     -> Popular Components in Hadoop EcoSystem             

          -> Resource Management Tool: YARN
          -> Coordination Management Tool: ZooKeeper
          -> Execution Frameworks: MapReduce, Spark, Tez
          -> SQL-Analytics: Hive, Impala, Drill
	  -> Streaming Data Processing: Kafka, Storm, Spark Streaming
	  -> Machine Learning: Mahout, Spark MLLib
          -> Scripting: Pig
          -> NoSQL database: HBase
          -> Data ingestion tools: Flume, Sqoop


  =======================================================================
     HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
  =======================================================================

   -> Storage Solution
   -> Stores data as blocks of 128 MB 
   -> Each block is replicated.

   HDFS Architecture
   -----------------

   Hadoop uses Master-Slave Architecture


   HDFS Daemons 
   ------------
     -> Daemon: Continuosly running background job. 

     1. Name Node (NN)	
	-> runs on the master machine (master daemon)
        -> recieves heart-beats from DNs.
	   -> if three successive heart-beats are missing from any DN, it is considered as 'dead'
        -> NN maintains two "meta-data" files
	    
           1. FSImage
		-> Persistent disk file
                -> Will contain all the meta-data info from the time that the NN service is started
                   upto the last checkpoint.

	   2. EditLog
		-> Maintained in memory (RAM)
		-> All incrmental changes are recorded in this file.        

     2. Data Node (DN)
	-> runs on every slave machine (salve daemon)
  	-> every DB sends heart-beats to NN once in every 3 seconds
 
        -> In every heart-beat, DN sends "block-report" of that node
           -> A 'block-report' consists of such info as storage data, which files, which blocks, 
              rep-factors, permissions, ...        
    
     3. Secondary Name Node (SNN)
          -> responsible for check-pointing process
              -> check-pointing is a process of merging the edit-log file with fsimage file.

     4. Balancer 
	  -> Ensures that the replication-factor of the files is maintained. 

          -> A file can become "under-replicated" if one nodes that contain the blocks of the
             goes down, or if the rep-factor of the file is increased. Then balencer creates
             additional replicas of the blocks of that file.  

	  -> A file can become "over-replicated" if one nodes that contain the blocks that was 
             previously down and  comes up again, or if the rep-factor of the file is decreased.
             Then balencer removes the replicas of the blocks of that file beyond the rep-factor.   


   HDFS High Availability
   ----------------------
     
      => Availability : Means that the system do not have any down-time. Always available to the client.
        
      => Hadoop High Availability is introduced in Hadoop 2.0 onwards. 
	   -> We have "Active NN" and "Stand-by Name Node"

      => Hadoop 1.x is not high availble system.
	   -> In Hadoop 1.x, Name Node is a 'Single Point of Failure'   



      HDFS File Operations
      ---------------------

       => HDFS is non-editable file system.

       Default Paths:

        * Cloudera Local Home :  /home/cloudera
        * HDFS Home: 		 /user/cloudera
        
        HDFS FS Command Syntax:  $hadoop fs -<command-name> <parameters>
                                 $hdfs dfs -<command-name> <parameters>

         
     
       Common File Ops
       ---------------

 * hadoop fs -help   				=> lists all the commands with a brief discription
 * hadoop fs -help <command-name>  
 * hadoop fs -chmod -R 755 <file/dir>		=> change permission for a file/directory
 * hadoop fs -cat <file-name>
 * hadoop fs -ls
 * hadoop fs -ls <dir-path>
 * hadoop fs -ls -R  <dir-path>

 * hadoop fs -cp <source file> <target dir>     => Copies within HDFS frpm source to target
 * hadoop fs -mv <source file> <target dir>     => Moves within HDFS frpm source to target
 * hadoop fs -rm -r <file-name/directory-name>
	 
 // copy from Linux to HDFS
 * hadoop -copyFromLocal <local file path>  <hdfs file path> 
 * hadoop -put <local file path>  <hdfs file path> 

 // copy from HDFS to Linux
 * hadoop -copyToLocal <hdfs file path> <local file path>   
 * hadoop -get <hdfs file path> <local file path>   

 * hadoop -moveFromLocal <local file path>  <hdfs file path> 
 * hadoop -moveToLocal <hdfs file path> <local file path> 


   ==========================================================
     YARN
  ==========================================================

   -> Resource Manager

   -> Hadoop 1.0,  MapReduce used to handle resource-management
       -> MR was the only execution process.

   -> Hadoop 2.0
	->  Resource Management:  YARN  (Yet another resource negotiator)
        ->  Execution: MapReduce

        -> Allowed hadoop to support other execution frameworks as-well
      
   YARN Processing Components
   --------------------------

       1. Resource Manager (daemon)  -> one per cluster, runs in a master node
       2. Node Manager (daemon)	     -> one per node, runs in all slave nodes
       3. Application Master         -> one per application, can run in any NN
       4. Set of Containers          -> Allocated to AM where tasks are executed

  ==========================================================
     MapReduce
  ==========================================================

   -> Distributed Processing Framework.

    
   Two facets of MapReduce
   ------------------------

    1. MapReduce execution flow (framework process)
	-> How an mR program is executed (what the system does)

	1. Map Phase (developer)  
        2. Combiner
	3. Shuffle & Sort Phase (framework)
        4. Partitioner
	5. Reduce Phase (developer)


    2. MapReduce Programming Structure
	-> How to write MR programs (what developers should do)

	-> An MR Application can have several programs (upto 5 different programs)
   		1. Driver Program 
		       -> master process where configuration details are specified.
		2. Mapper
			-> Logic defined by the developer
			-> has map() method that run once for every input record
		3. Reducer
			-> Logic defined by the developer
			-> has reduce() method that run once for every input record
		4. Combiner
			-> Like a mini-reducer logic applied to the output of each mapper
                        -> Will reduce the amount of data shuffled and improves performance
                        -> Operation has to be commutative.  
		5. Partitioner
			-> Allows the developer to control which keys  goes to which partition
                           based on his own custom implementation.
   
   
   MapReduce Framework Classes
   ---------------------------

   1. InputFormat -> It will identify 'records' from the blocks

   2. InputSplit -> Creates input-split
                    An input-split will have integral number of records.
                    Each input-split can span multiple-blocks.

   3. RecordReader -> Will read input-splits and create (K,V) pairs from the records
                     Call map() method in a mapper with each record.



    MapReduce DataTypes
    -------------------
    -> MR data-types are optimized for serialization & deserialization.
    -> All MR class uses MapReduce Custom Data Types
    
      Java                MapReduce
      ----                ---------
      String		  Text
      Integer		  IntWritable
      Long		  LongWritable
      Boolean		  BoolWritable
      Null		  NullWritable


    Wordcount Program
    -----------------
    Find the word frequency count of all the words in a given text file.
   

    Input-Split
    ------------
InputSplit                          RecordReader														Shuffle & Sort  			Reduce      

hadoop spark scala flatmap    	-> (1, "hadoop spark scala flatmap") --> map(k, v, context) --> (hadoop, 1) (spark, 1) (scala, 1) (flatmap, 1)   ===>   (hadoop, [1,1,1,1])    		   => reduce => (hadoop, 4)                                  
map groupby spark spark		-> (27, "map groupby spark spark")          			(map, 1) (groupby, 1) (spark, 1) (spark, 1)       	(spark, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1])              (spark, 12)
hadoop spark scala flatmap 	-> (50, "hadoop scala flume oozie")	    			(hadoop, 1) (spark, 1) (scala, 1) (flatmap, 1)          (flatmap, [1,1,1,1)                             (flatmap, 4)

    $yarn jar <jar-file-path> <driver-class-qualified-name> <commad-line-args>
   
    $hadoop jar /home/cloudera/mrpractice.jar com.sample.WordCountJob <input-file-path> <output-dir>
    
 
    MapReduce Life Cycle Methods
    ----------------------------


	Mapper Life Cycle methods
	--------------------------

	1. setup	-> Called once at the beginning of the MR process before the map() method
                           is called.
			-> Write initialization code.			
			  
	2. map		-> Executed once for every record in the input-split
			-> Write the logic that you want to apply on the record.

	3. cleanup	-> Called once after the map() method is completed for all records.
			-> Release your resource and other cleanup.

	4. run 		-> Generally not overridden
                        -> Can use this to change the execution flow.


	Reducer Life Cycle methods
	---------------------------

	1. setup	-> Called once at the beginning of the MR process before the reduce() method
                           is called.
			-> Write initialization code.			
			  
	2. reduce       -> Executed once for every record in the input-split
			-> Write the logic that you want to apply on the record.

	3. cleanup	-> Called once after the reduce() method is completed for all records.
			-> Release your resource and other cleanup.

	4. run 		-> Generally not overridden
                        -> Can use this to change the execution flow.
   

     Facebook Dataset Processing
     ---------------------------
    
     From the facebook dataset, extract the record with maximum likes_received from among the records
     of people born between 1990 and 2000.

     MR 1: Extract the records of people born between 1990 and 2000.
     MR 2: To find out the record with maximum likes_received 



    Hadoop Configuartion Files
    --------------------------  
       location:  /etc/hadoop/conf

       -> core-site.xml
       -> hdfs-site.xml
       -> mapred-site.xml


   =============================
       Hive
   =============================

    Hive is Hadoop's Data Warehousing Framework.
    
    Hive is an SQL wrapper on top of map-reduce. So that user can directly work with SQL without
    having to write MR programs. Hive Server can create the MR programs and run them on the cluster
    releaving the analysts from writing MR programs.

    => Hive is NOT an RDBMS. 
    => Hive is NOT a NoSQL database

    Hive provides a dialect of SQL called "Hive Query Language" (HQL, HiveQL)


    Hive Components
    ----------------
  
    1. Hive Warehouse - An HDFS directory where hive stores all its data files of all its managed tables.
                        In cloudera:  /user/hive/warehouse

    2. Hive MetaStore - MetaStore is typically an RDBMS where hive stores its metadata
                        (Most popular option in production systems is MySQL)
                        -> Hive comes with an embedded metastore database called "derby"
        -> Warehouse  : DATA
	-> Meta Store : METADATA

    3. Hive Server   - Responsible for executing HQL statements (and creating MR programs if required)



    How to Access Hive ?
    --------------------

    1. Command Line Interface (CLI Shells)
	-> hive shell  
		-> Local hive installations with default user.
		-> Less secure

        -> beeline shell (preferred for security reasons)
		-> Connects to Hive using JDBC connection with a specific user credential
                -> More secure.

    2. HUE (Hadoop User Environment)
         -> Provides a Web UI to interact with various Hadoop tools.

    3. Client Applications  ( JDBC, ODBC, Thrift )


   Hive File Structure 
   -------------------
   
    Hive Warehouse:  /user/hive/warehouse

    ->  Hive created separate directories for each database in the Hive warehouse
        (exception: no separate directory for 'default' database)

    -> For every table in the database, a separate directory is created.
       All the data files of that table are saved in that directory.

       ex: db1.emp   ==> /user/hive/warehouse/db1.db/emp
	   db1.emp2  ==> /user/hive/warehouse/db1.db/emp2


   Working with Tables
   -------------------

	CREATE TABLE empinfo (empid INT, empname STRING, salary DOUBLE, deptid SMALLINT)
	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
	FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
	LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
	STORED AS TEXTFILE;


   Defaults
   --------
        -> default serde: DELIMITED
        -> default storage format : TEXTFILE
        -> default line terminator: \n
        -> default field terminator: Ctrl-A  ( \0001 )           

   Describe
   ---------
    -> describe empinfo
	-> describe extended empinfo
	-> describe formatted empinfo    


    How to load/insert data into Hive tables
    ----------------------------------------    
    1. Load data from external data files (such as delimited files (csv, tsv), or parquet, orc, sequence,..)
    2. Insert data into an existing table from a base table ( INSERT .. SELECT )
    3. Insert data using INSERT..VALUES command (not recommended)..  
   

     -> location of data file: Linux, HDFS       ( LOCAL INPATH: Linux,   INPATH: HDFS )
     -> Append the data / Overwrite the data     ( INTO TABLE: append,  OVERWRITE INTO TABLE: overwrite )   

       
        // Loading from Linux
       	LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH <linux-file-path> INTO TABLE <table-name>
	LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH <linux-file-path> OVERWRITE INTO TABLE <table-name>
             	=> Loading from Linux a "Copy" operation

   
        // Loading from HDFS
   	LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs-file-path> INTO TABLE <table-name>
	LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs-file-path> OVERWRITE INTO TABLE <table-name>
		=> Loading from HDFS a "Move" operation


    Hive follows Scehma on Read
    ---------------------------
    -> Hive do not control what data goes into the table. 
    -> Schema validation does not happen while "loading" data into the table.
    -> Scahema validation happens while reading the data.
       -> If the data can not be parsed as per schema, Hive shows NULL for that field.


    Managed Tables
    --------------
        -> Managed tables are managed by Hive and are stored in Hive warehouse directory.
        -> When you drop a managed table, Hive drops the schema as well as the data files. 

    
    External Tables
    ---------------
        -> External tables are not managed by Hive.
        -> The data files of external table are not stored in Hive warehouse. 
        -> They are stored in an external location specified while creating the table.
        -> The data loaded into external table either from hive or from any other application/tool
           is not owned/managed by Hive.
        -> When we drop the table, ONLY schema is dropped. The data files are NOT DROPPED.
  

    Use Cases for External tables
    -----------------------------

       -> External tables are used when multiple hive databases are using the same data. 
       -> You can create an external table pointing to existing data, analyze that data and drop the
          table without affecting the actual data.


    Partitioned Tables
    ------------------

     In Hive, Partitions provide a way of dividing a table into coarse-grained 
     parts based on the value of a partition column, such as a date or country.


     Partitioning allows us to create tables partitioned by one or more columns.
     
     Each unique value of the partitioned column will have its own directory 
     within the table's directory.

     Based on the way we load data into the tables we can have static & dynamic partitions

     -> Partition columns should reasonably low-cardinality columns (such as year, country, month, ...)


     Static Partitioning
     -------------------
	-> The data files are loaded by the user using "LOAD DATA .." command
        -> The user has to know precisly to which partition he is loading the file.


     Dynamic Partitioning
     --------------------
	-> We dynamic partitioning when the user do not know to which partition the data goes to.
           This may be because the partition info itself is there in the data or may be we have
           data of many partitions in the same file. 

        -> We can not use "LOAD DATA.." command to load the data into the partitioned table

        -> We have to load the data using dynamic partitioning scheme from a base table using
           "INSERT .. SELECT .." command. 

        -> Data files are created dynamically by hive (hense the name dynamic partitioning)

        -> set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict


 
   Working with Bucketted Tables
    ------------------------------

	set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;


	INSERT INTO TABLE students_buckets
	SELECT id, name, mobile, email, project, country, batch FROM students;
	SELECT * FROM students_buckets WHERE id = 20;

	CREATE TABLE students_part_batch(id int, name string, mobile string, email string, project string, country string)
	PARTITIONED BY (batch int)
	CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 5 BUCKETS
	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
	FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
	LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
	STORED AS TEXTFILE;

	INSERT INTO TABLE students_part_batch
	PARTITION (batch)
	SELECT id, name, mobile, email, project, country, batch FROM students;


	SELECT * FROM students_part_batch TABLESAMPLE (BUCKET 1 OUT OF 2 on id);


     Managing Outputs
     ---------------

       SELECT * FROM Students
  
		-> You can return the data to the client application.
		-> insert the data into a table (INSERT ... SELECT ...)
		-> create a table with the output of  a query (CREATE TABLE AS SELECT..)
		-> Save the output of a query into a local directory or hdfs directory in desired format. 


       INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '<linux-directory>' STORED AS TEXTFILE select * from students;  
       INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '<hdfs-directory>' STORED AS ORC select * from students;

 Working with different file formats
 -----------------------------------

     ORC & Parquet   ==> Columnar File Formats 
                       -> Store all column information together at one physical location.
                       -> This improves performance of aggrgations
                       -> As aggregations are heavily used in analytical warkloads, these formats are very
                          efficient in data-warehouseing like use-cases.

                   => Very good read performance
                   => moderatly good write performance
                   => Splittable
		   => Compressable


     Avro  => Is used where we need schema evolution. 
                 -> The data schema is embedded in the file itself.

     Sequence => Stores data in the form of (K, V) pairs.
